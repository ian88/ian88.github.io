This week's blog post will be a bit different. I didn't travel anywhere for the weekend because my friend Carson was visiting from Ireland where he studies abroad so instead I want to talk about the block course I took this past week called Workshop II. Workshop II was a one-week hands-on course run by Professor Peter Kumble for students from CZU and Charles University (another university in Prague). The course is a requirement for Landscape Planning and Nature Conservation graduate students but it was open to exchange students as well. I signed up during the first week of the semester and was starting to regret my choice later in the semester because I didn't want to be gone from Prague during one of my last weeks but ended up being glad I went. It was interesting to do more hands-on conservation work and refreshing to not be sitting in a classroom. I met a lot of great people and learned a thing or two as well. I wish the course had taken place earlier in the semester, it was great to make new friends but now I only have one week left in Prague and likely won't see them again. It was also refreshing to spend a week away from my American friends and interact with more Europeans than I usually do. 

For the workshop, we spent the week in the small Czech town of Slavonice. Slavonice has around 2300 residents and is located around a mile from the Austrian border. Historically, Slavonice was located along a main trade corridor in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and at one point the town had a large defensive wall and mote. Now, the town mainly relies on tourism during the summer. We were told Slavonice gets quite busy but we were there a bit early because it was very empty for most of while we were there. The small town's character and proximity to agricultural fields and forests made it a good fit for landscape planning and native conservation work. Professor Kumble has been taking his students to Slavonice for this workshop for many years so has a good understanding of the town and surrounding area and has built relationships with many people living in Slavonice. He also brought in other professors and grad students to help with our projects for the week. 

We spent most of our time either in the field collecting data or at the Slavonice Center for the Future analyzing the data and creating our final PowerPoints. The Center of the Future is a renovated school building that now hosts company workshops, rock shows, movies, and anything else Slavonice needs.

For housing, the 30 students in the Workshop were spread around the town wherever there was room. I got placed in a brand new guest house a little bit off the main square with two students from Charles University: Felix from Germany, and Luca from Italy. Both of them were very nice and easy to get along with! Our guest house had two floors and a nearly full kitchen. I got lucky enough to be by myself on the first floor with a queen bed. Not bad for $25 a night.

## Monday

We left the Prague Main Station at 8 am this morning and headed for Slavonice. After one short train change, we arrived in Slavonice at 12:30 pm. I'm continually amazed that even some of the smallest towns in Czechia are reachable by train. Professor Kumble set everyone up in their accommodations for the week and then gave us some time for lunch. I went with Felix and Luca to a restaurant on the main square and got some pork noodles. We reconvened with the group at 3 to go in the Slavonice underground and up the lookout tower. The underground was a very unique experience. We were given rubber boots and rain jackets to put on and headed into the very narrow underground tunnels. Our guide told us the underground was originally built in the 13th century when it was used for water drainage, groundwater collection, and protection against invading armies. Now, some of the underground has been opened up to the public for short tours. Our tour was about 30 minutes long and involved crouching our way through two 50-meter stretches with a break in the middle in a larger room in the middle to learn some of the underground's history. Crouching my way through the tunnels was probably the most confined I've ever been in a cave-like area. There were points when I was fully crouching and had to turn myself sideways to fit around a tight bend. Not somewhere I would want to be for extended periods. The very sporadic lighting and half a foot of water on the ground didn't help either. Still a very unique experience that I'm glad I did. Next, we went up the clock tower in the town square. Again, it was very cramped at the top but there were great views of all of Slavonice and the surrounding area. After the tower, Professor Kumble gave us a short tour of Slavonice, pointing out the sgraffito and old outer defense wall. Sgraffito was a technique that became very popular during the 16th century in Czechia. It involves coating a wall with multiple layers of different plaster colors and then scraping away the plaster to create intricate designs. The sgraffito buildings were gorgeous.

## Tuesday

Today was a long day of walking. We began by walking down one of the bicycle trails to the Austrian border. It's so amazing that the border between Czechia and Austria is only marked by a change of signage indicating you're now on the Austrian bike trail. We stopped many times along the way for the professors to point out important ecological areas or inform us of the history of the area. One of the notable features was all the bunkers on the Czech side. Apparently over 1000 bunkers were built in Czechia near the beginning of WWII for use against the Germans if they invaded through Austria. The bunkers were never used but proved too difficult to remove so they've just become part of the Czech landscape. We spent a few hours walking through the Austrian countryside, stopping occasionally to discuss the land around us and to put up motion-sensing wildlife cameras. When we crossed back into Czechia, Kumble pointed out what looked to be a thriving forest and said that this used to be a small Czech town until the Iron Curtain was formed. The town was too close to the border and could have provided Czechs with an easier location to try to escape to Austria. There was no visible evidence of the town from the path which was incredible. In general, it was amazing how little evidence of the Iron Curtain still exists in the area. No signs of the barbed border wall and associated border surveillance were evident except for some very straight military roads. We stopped for lunch at a delicious small restaurant seemingly in the middle of nowhere called Restaurace Maříž. After lunch, we continued back towards Slavonice. We stopped once on the way to look at the ruins of an old manor house. In total, we walked almost 15 miles. It was a rewarding day.

## Wednesday and Thursday

On Wednesday morning we divided up into groups of 4-6 people to work on our smaller projects depending on what topic we found most interesting during the walk on Tuesday. I chose to work with the water quality ground, analyzing the Slavonický Potok stream that flows through Slavonice. We began by taking rental bikes and biking three miles to the stream's headwaters. We took water samples at the headwater spring and three of the nearby downstream fish ponds. On the bike ride back we stopped at the ruins of an ancient farming village. Back in Slavonice, we took water samples, before, inside, and after the village. We spent the rest of the day and most of Thursday analyzing the data, collecting more data when needed, and creating a PowerPoint displaying our findings and possible solutions. We discovered that the Slavonice Waste Water Treatment Plant was releasing very high concentrations of NO3 into the stream. We proposed the creation of a small constructed wetland to remove the NO3 but that would involve a fairly significant investment from the town. On Wednesday night the Institute hosted a cookout for the students on the Workshop and local people from Slavonice. We had a fun evening playing table tennis, pool, and cards.

## Friday

We spent most of the morning listening to the groups present on their topic. There was a lot of interesting information about riparian restoration, biocorridors, bikeways, and bird sightings. At 1 pm we took the train back to Prague in what felt like a very anticlimactic end to an enjoyable week.
