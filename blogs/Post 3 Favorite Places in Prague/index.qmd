## Charles Bridge

The most famous bridge in Prague, so many statues and it gets lit up beautifully at night.

## Astronomical Clock

The oldest astronomical clock in the world! Constructed back in the early 15th century. The clock itself is fascinatingly intricate and there’s a cool little moving show when the clock strikes the hour.

## Prague Castle

Probably the most famous building in Prague. The Castle itself I found a little underwhelming because in my head castle mean medieval castle with turrets and a moat. That being said St. Vitus Cathedral in the central of the castle is beautiful and the view of Prague from the castle is incredible! I’ll have to go back at some point and pay to go inside the castle to see the museum and photo gallery.

## Lennon Wall

Probably the coolest mural wall I’ve seen. So much history in one place. The tradition of painting the wall started during the Soviet oppression of Czechia as a way to defy Soviet control. The Soviets would paid over the wall frequently but the wall would be filled with paintings and inspirational messages the very next day. Our tour guide said that now they host poem days where they string up paper and anyone can come and share a poem for others to read.

## Vítkov

Vítkov is a national monument and park on top of a large hill with great views of the city. Would recommend as a sunset location! The monument is super impressive too.

## Dancing House

Dancing house was one of our first destinations as a group. It’s a super cool looking hotel with a rooftop bar and a great view of the Vltava River and downtown Prague!
