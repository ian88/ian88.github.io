This map was created for a lab assignment in Geography 370: Introduction to Cartography at UW-Madison. The goal of the lab was to create a reference map of Africa including all 55 Capital cities, 47 additional cities, 10 marine areas, 5 major rivers, and 55 natural landscape features. I used Adobe Illustrator for a significant portion of this lab to organize all of the labels in a coherent way that maximized clarity. The final reference map is shown below along with the initial version exported from ArcGiS Pro before any label styling and adjustments were completed.

## Final Map

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/Map.png")
```

## Before Label Adjustments
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/Initial.png")
```
