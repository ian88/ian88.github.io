<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="battle-for-prague">Battle for Prague</h2>
<p>For most of the semester Česká Zemědělská Univerzita has nothing in the way of sports culture but wow did that change for the Battle of Prague. Once a semester the four main universities in Prague, Czech University of Life Sciences (ČZU), Czech Technical University (ČVUT), Charles University (UK), and the University of Economics (VŠE), come together for a tournament to determine the best team in Prague. During the fall semester play in games ČZU lost so we played for third place against VŠE this semester. Before the game, we all bought ČZU scarves to show our spirit. Some of us went early to the pregame parade to the stadium, complete with green hair spray, face paint, free beer, and a police escort. It was really entertaining to be walking with a bunch of Czech students and shouting chants without having any idea what they meant. At the stadium, we met up with the rest of the group and went into the stadium. We went to a ČZU game in February and were very disappointed by the lack of fan turnout and energy but tonight was completely different. The stadium was packed with fans from the four schools and energy was super high. I daresay there was more fan energy than at UW, or at least comparable to the UW student section at hockey games. We had a total blast even though ČZU was by far the worst team. We lost 4-2 and it was never a competition, I think the loss extends our losing streak to 9 games…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="munich">Munich</h2>
<p>We had a fun but rainy weekend of sightseeing in Munich. We took a morning Flixbus and arrived in Munich at 2. After checking into the Wombat hostel, which I can highly recommend, we headed out to see the sights. We visited Munich Cathedral, St Peter’s Cathedral, and the New Town Hall in Munich’s central square, Marienplatz. St Peter’s Cathedral was beautiful with gold statues and murals, and we were lucky enough to have a live choir performing while we were there. We also paid to climb up the south tower for fantastic views of Munich. The view of the New Town Hall from the top was incredible, such a unique-looking building. We climbed down in time to catch the last of the three daily clock shows. The buildup of bells chiming took a full 10 minutes before the show started but it was worth the wait. Life-sized figures reenact jousting and dancing scenes from Munich’s history. It knocked the Prague astronomical clock’s show out of the water. For dinner, we went to Hofbräuhaus which was the largest restaurant I have ever been in, there was easily seating for 1000 people. We enjoyed some beer steins and traditional German food, it was a good time. Day two was rainy all morning. We were cold and wet on our walk to Eisbachwelle to see the river surfers but it was well worth it. They were incredible. What a cool thing to be able to do in the middle of a big city like Munich. After watching for a while we migrated to a St Patrick’s Day festival with live music but we were all so cold that we left pretty quickly. Near the festival, we stopped at Theatine Church and St.&nbsp;Michael München. Theatine Church had incredible stone carvings throughout the church, I can’t imagine the amount of work that went into it. Overall I enjoyed Munich, it was nice to walk from our hostel to all of the famous buildings in under half an hour. The food was good but expensive compared to Prague. I wish we had gotten better weather but we got so spoiled in Innsbruck that we were due for a not-as-good weather weekend, and it really only rained for a few hours the whole time.</p>

<section id="innsbruck" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="innsbruck">Innsbruck</h2>
<p>Gonna be hard to top this weekend trip, Innsbruck is such a fantastic little city nestled in the Alps. Every time I’m in the mountains I’m blown away and question why I don’t live in a mountainous place all the time. Innsbruck is the kind of city I would love to live in when I’m older. Close to the mountains, not too big, relaxed culture, great public transport, and did I mention close to the mountains? We stayed at the Meininger Hotel in a six-person hostel room. It was super nice to have a room totally to ourselves to lay out all of our stinky skiing stuff at the end of the day. The hostel was across the street from the University of Innsbruck and the Inn River. I was very jealous. Every evening at sunset, students would sit on the side of the river, drink a beer, and chat. So naturally, we did the same the nights we were there. Everyone looked so happy and carefree, exactly my type of outdoor-loving people. Downtown Innsbruck was a fifteen-minute walk from the hostel and is super cute, but we really only went there to get food. The first night we went to Stiftskeller restaurant. I ordered a delicious mac and cheese dish, which even came with a salad! Prague could never. The food came in less than five minutes, it actually might have been the fastest restaurant service I’ve ever experienced. The second night we went to a pizza place called Trattoria-Pizzeria Due Sicilie. Such a cute little Italian place with great pizza and service for a pretty reasonable price by Innsbruck standards. Might have been my favorite meal to date. On the third night, we got takeaway burritos from Machete. The burritos were pretty average, I’ve had much better in Madison, but it was fun to eat along the river. I’m really hoping to be able to come back to Innsbruck in May to go hiking!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skiing-at-schlick-2000">Skiing at Schlick 2000</h2>
<p>I love skiing in the Alps! We chose Schlick 2000 as our ski destination since it was an easy half-hour bus ride from Innsbruck. All in we spent $180 for two days of skiing and rentals which feels like a pretty great deal considering it would be more expensive to ski on crappy Midwest hills for the same amount of time. Schlick 2000 is hidden from the road by the crest of a smaller hill. It was amazing to take the gondola up and have the mountain and trails emerge in front of me. Schlick has 15 miles of groomed trails, which were starting to get repetitive by the end, but still a lot of fun, especially considering even the easiest trails near the gondola were the same difficulty as the hardest trails at the ski places I’ve been to near Madison. The most fun I had was skiing the off-piste routes with Aubrey. Lots of steep moguls and weaving around trees, it was a blast and I felt myself get more competent every run! I felt bad for the ski rental place because I put quite a few dents and scratches on my skis. Both days we skied were absolutely gorgeous. We had highs in the 40s and perfectly clear and sunny. I was skiing in only a sweatshirt and still was sweating. The snow wasn’t great, it was a weird combination of slushy at lower elevations and icy on the steeper runs near the top of the mountain. The off-piste snow was better, although a bit thin, and even the worst spots were totally manageable. One of the workers said they hadn’t gotten any snow since December, all of the snow was created. I think we might have gotten in on the last good weekend of skiing for the season.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="budapest">Budapest</h2>
<p>Budapest was amazing and a perfect destination for our first trip out of Czechia. The city felt very similar to Prague in a lot of respects. From a tourist perspective, Budapest has more things to do and visit than Prague since it’s a fair bit larger, but it lacks the quaintness that makes Prague so special. The public transportation was fantastic, possibly even better than Prague’s, which is a high bar to pass, and the metro stations were super unique looking. That being said, there were a lot more cars which noticeably detracted from my enjoyment. The architectural style of most of the buildings felt very similar, with lots of ornate buildings and red roofs. I find it very interesting that neither Prague nor Budapest has anything in the way of skyscrapers. Budapest technically has one but it would barely count by US standards. We stayed at the Maverick Central Market Hostel, which I can highly recommend. It was cheap, clean, a great location, and let us store our luggage for free before check-in.</p>

<p>After taking the overnight Flixbus from Prague, we arrived half asleep to Budapest at 6 am. Thankfully the thermal baths awaited us. Three hours soaking in warm pools and saunas was so delightful, I need to find something similar in Prague. I can highly recommend Lukacs Baths if you’re ever in Budapest, only $10 for the whole day! We spent the rest of the day sightseeing! First on the agenda was St.&nbsp;Stephen’s Basilica, I didn’t have time to go inside, but the outside was very impressive. Next up was the Hungarian Parliament Building, which I would put in the running for most beautiful parliament building in the world, especially when it’s lit up at night. From there we went to the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe. Tickets to go inside were $30, unfortunately, but we walked around the outside and read up on the building’s history. Last on the landmarks list for the day was the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, which looked like a castle, with a moat and everything. For dinner we went to a restaurant called Babka, I ordered the Jemen Goulash. It was delicious and the presentation was amazing.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="saturday">Saturday</h2>
<p>Another packed day of Budapest sightseeing. We started with Budapest Castle. Learning about the history of the Siege of Budapest by the Soviets and Romanians at the end of World War II was sobering. I’m amazed at how well the city has recovered after having its population and buildings so decimated. We didn’t end up going into the Castle to the history museum, but the view of Budapest from the top was beautiful. We managed to be timed perfectly for the hourly changing of the guards, I like that ceremonial stuff like that still has a place. Next we visited the Church of Saint Matthias which is one of the most incredible buildings I’ve ever seen. The hexagon tiling on the roof and the golden interior was all so amazing. For sunset we went to Gellért Hill, which has beautiful bluffs that overlook the city center. We ended the night with a prosecco cruise. Unlimited prosecco and truffle pasta is a dangerous combination but we had a great time.</p>

<section id="hiking-trip" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hiking-trip">Hiking Trip</h2>
<p>On February 8th, ESN organized a hiking trip in the Czech countryside near Kamenný Přívoz village, about an hour’s train ride south of Prague (I love the train network here!!). We hiked seven miles following the Sázava river. The landscape reminded me a lot of Oregon, with rolling hills and bluffs, and lots of evergreens. Getting out of the city on a hike and talking with other CZU students was great! My favorite part was the small houses built on the side of the bluffs! I have no idea how they get down to their houses, let alone how they built them. It looked like such a peaceful life living on the river, I’m envious. I want to do more hiking day trips around Czechia, Bohemian Switzerland National Park might be next.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kutná-hora">Kutná Hora</h2>
<p>On February 16, our group took a day trip to Kutná Hora, which was also just an hour away by train (I promise I’ll stop praising the trains eventually). Kutná Hora is known for the Sedlec Ossuary, also called the Bone Church. The inside of the church is pretty incredible, there are pyramid stacks and hanging arrangements built from thousands of bones of people from the 14th and 15th centuries who died from the bubonic plague and Hussite Wars. We also visited the Cathedral of Assumption of Our Lady and St.&nbsp;John the Baptist. The interior had a lot of beautiful murals and gold statues. I love all of the old churches and cathedrals in Europe, even the ones in small towns are so amazingly intricate.</p>

<p>Everyone I’ve met here is so friendly and fun! There are ten of us from UW living in Dormitory JIH so we quickly became good friends. Nine of us started this semester, and Sam started fall semester and is staying the full year, so he’s been a great resource for things to do in Prague. I didn’t know any of them before coming to Prague, so it’s been great to meet new people I’ll remain friends with back at UW.</p>

<p>The ESN organized events have been a great way to meet other international students! During the first events, we met a great group of French who have quickly become our closest non-American friends. Artemis from Greece has also joined our close circle, and came with us to Budapest last weekend! I’ve also become friends with people from Germany, Austria, South Korea, Turkey and Brazil! Many of them live at the external dormitory, which is half an hour from campus, so it can be difficult to make plans, but it’s fun to see them at classes and ESN events. I haven’t met any Czechs yet, the ESN events aren’t geared towards Czech students and my classes are mainly international students. I have embarrassingly few group pictures with everyone, I’ll have to work on that.</p>

The Soviets would paid over the wall frequently but the wall would be filled with paintings and inspirational messages the very next day. Our tour guide said that now they host poem days where they string up paper and anyone can come and share a poem for others to read.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Prague is amazing! I’m sure anyone who’s visited here feels the same, it really is a magical city. I love the architecture and the cobbled streets. Everything feels like it has so much more character and life than anywhere in the US.</p>
<section id="public-transport" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-transport">Public Transport</h2>
<p>I think my favorite part about Prague might be the public transport. With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.</p>

<p>So far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.</p>

<section id="drinking-culture" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drinking-culture">Drinking Culture</h2>
<p>It’s hard to talk about Prague without talking about beer. Seriously, it feels like nearly everything I do in Prague involves drinking. It’s easy to see how Czechia has by far the highest beer consumption of any country. The get-to-know-you events (human bingo, trivia, tour of Prague) for students studying abroad put on by the European Student Network either took place at a bar or ended at one. Even the dorms on campus have bars on the ground floor, not to mention the CZU club. It’s very jarring to see the heavy drinking culture in Madison get outmatched almost instantly in Prague. That being said, there is plenty to do in Prague that doesn’t involve drinking, it’s just harder to find places to hang out that aren’t bars than I would like.</p>

<section id="food" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="food">Food</h2>
<p>The food in Prague has been great so far, and more importantly it’s cheap! I try to cook as many of my meals as I can, but when I go out, most of the places are $7 or less for a full meal, although we mostly end up going to chains. Some of my favorites include Bageterie Boulevard, a Czech chain that serves delicious warm baguette sandwiches, Vietfood, which serves surprisingly good Vietnamese and other asian dishes, and any kebab shop we can find. I think kebabs make up half of the meals I’ve eaten in Prague, and that’s not even that much of an exaggeration. Kebab in Prague means a tortilla filled with gyro meat, cabbage, lettuce, onion, garlic sauce, and chilli sauce wrapped up like a burrito. There are kebab shops all over Prague, it’s just too easy and delicious to pass up.</p>

</div>
<p>Embarrassingly, I’ve only gotten Czech food one time, and while it was pretty decent, there’s a good reason Czechia isn’t known for its cuisine. I want to go out for Czech food again in the future, but it’s just so convenient to go to my standbys of Bageterie Boulevard, Vietfood, or kebab.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Hello from Prague! This is my third week in Prague and I’m starting to feel pretty settled in so I decided it’s time to do my first blog post! The last three weeks have been a blur, it simultaneously feels like I’ve been here for no time at all and also multiple months. I’m going to try to post weekly forward, but I’m going to be playing catch up for the last few weeks first.</p>
<section id="czu" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="czu">CZU</h2>
<p>I’m spending my semester abroad at the Czech University of Life Sciences (Česká Zemědělská Univerzita in Czech). The university is in Prague 6, about seven miles from the city center, which ends up being around a half hour away on public transport. The campus itself is pretty small, especially compared to the sprawling University of Wisconsin I’m used to. It’s nice to have all my classes within a quick 7-minute walk, and for the campus to be mostly car-free. There are around 20,000 students who study at CZU, but it honestly feels a fair bit smaller. My largest class only has like 15 students. The campus buildings feel new, or at least recently remodeled, with nice classrooms and layouts. Because the university is geared towards agriculture and environmental students, there’s a good amount of greenspace and even a small farm with llamas!</p>

<section id="classes" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classes">Classes</h2>
<p>Classes themselves are probably the biggest letdown of the whole experience so far. I’m used to the rigor of UW classes so it’s jarring to only meet for classes once a week for an hour and a half lecture, and then have virtually no assignments to do between classes. While at CZU I’m in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and am taking all ecology courses: Wetland Conservation and Management, Forest Ecology, Non-forest Vegetation, and Ecosystem Conservation and Management. Two of my courses have twenty-minute presentations as the only assignment besides the final, another one has some short readings. My last class doesn’t have any assignments, just a couple of half-day field trips, which hopefully are a good experience. It’s nice to have more free time than in Madison, but I am quickly realizing that I need the consistency of assignments to occupy my days and make me feel like I’m doing something productive. The lectures do teach a fair bit of information, but without assignments, I don’t think very much of it will sink in. I’m just hoping I take some knowledge away from the semester so the courses aren’t a total waste.</p>

<section id="dorms" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dorms">Dorms</h2>
<p>The dorms here are less than ideal. I know all dorms are pretty bad, but these seem even worse than where I stayed for freshman year at UW. There are no common rooms, just a very cramped room with a ping-pong table. The dorm rooms are reasonably big but the linoleum floor collects dust like nobody’s business. We share a bathroom with two people in the room next door, which isn’t too bad, but the bathroom looks like it hasn’t been updated since the 50s and all the cabinets are rusted shut. It’s all manageable because the room costs less than $300 per month, but we know people in the same dorm who have a brand new updated bathroom despite paying the same, so we’re salty. The one good thing I can say about the bathroom is that the water pressure and heat are top notch. For cooking, the dorm room comes with a mini fridge and small hot plate, which just barely does the job. I’ve been able to make breakfast burritos, pasta, and curry, but only having one burner feels very limiting. Thankfully the grocery store is only a 10 minute bus ride away and I shop multiple times per week so the mini fridge isn’t too restrictive.</p>
