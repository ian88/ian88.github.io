<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday">Thursday</h2>
<p>Today was a long day of travel. Our plane left Prague at 11 a.m., and we got to the airport a bit early, so we had some fun playing FIFA on the free PS5s they have at the AC Sparta store. Unfortunately, we got stuck with a three-hour layover in Vienna because Austrian Airlines was the cheapest flight. Fortunately, the Vienna airport had free foosball and Nintendo to kill some time. Our flight to Mallorca arrived at around 6 pm, and Amelia’s friend Jade and her friend Raff picked us up from the airport. We had initially tried to find a way to make our Mallorca trip work without having to rent cars, but our Airbnb was far from Palma, and the public transport on the island isn’t very good. Having cars to visit more beaches and to be able to see more of the Island was totally worth it. Plus, the car rentals only turned out to be $45 per person for the four days we were there, which seemed like a great deal. We arrived at the Airbnb an hour later, and it was incredible! Beautiful little four-bedroom, eight-bed house in a small town, only a ten-minute walk from the ocean. The house had a pool, but it was never warm enough to swim comfortably. Shout out to Carmen for being a great Airbnb host and for being willing to take her chance on renting to us even though we were well under her age minimum of 30 (for the record, we were very good guests). For sunset, we walked down to the local beach, Cala S’Amarador. Unfortunately, it was cloudy and windy, but it still felt amazing to be on the ocean.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of our rental cars got rear-ended on the way to the beach, but thankfully, we had paid for full insurance coverage, and only the license plate was damaged. Caló des Moro was gorgeous! The water was crystal clear, and cliffs jutted out into the ocean. Reminded me a bit of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula. There were people cliff jumping on the other side of the beach, so naturally we had to join in. The cliff was only like ten feet above the water, but it was such a blast. We only went in twice, though, because it was cold and windy when we got out. Honestly, the water felt warmer than the air. We still ended up hanging out for a long while and even ate lunch there. After we walked around one of the cliffs to another beautiful beach. The whole area was managed by a local family, which I think is great.</p>

<p>This beach was a bit of a nightmare to get to. Google Maps had no idea that the route it wanted us to take involved private, gated-off roads. It took us a lot of tries to figure out where to go. At one point, we found ourselves on a narrow one-lane dirt road that abruptly dead-ended. We had to do a 25-point turn to get back on track. Half an hour later, we finally made it to the beach. It was a half-mile walk along the coast to the beach from the parking lot. Cabrera Island was visible in the distance the whole time. It would be interesting to visit at some point since I think it’s all a national park. We didn’t actually make it to the beach because we found a fun rock outcropping with some old stone structures to explore. And no one was in the mood to swim with the cool weather and wind.</p>

<p>I loved the Es Pontàs arch! Such a cool natural formation, I was surprised it wasn’t more crowded at the lookout point. Cala Sanranyi was the most touristy of the beaches we visited today. There were a lot of hotels built right next to it. Luckily, it wasn’t crowded. We lay out on towels for an hour until it got too cold. The only person swimming was a small kid who was having fun trying to jump over the waves.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boat-cruise">Boat cruise</h3>
<p>Most of today was spent on a boat cruise through Magic Catamarans! It was fantastic to spend so much time on the water, but it was very cold. The weather was overcast most of the day, and there was a lot of wind on the boat. We hung out in mesh at the front of the boat the whole time. They offered snorkeling equipment, which we were stoked about before the cruise, but after getting whipped around by the cold wind, no one was excited about jumping in the water, and there wasn’t anything to see underwater either. We were served a decent lunch with a kebab, chicken breast, brat, and salad. They also gave out glasses of sangria, which helped take the chill off. Warmer weather and sun would have made it a better experience, but we still had a great time, hard to complain when you’re on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We finished the cruise at around 3 and headed into the Palma city center. We got our souvenir shopping out of the way and visited Palma Cathedral. We weren’t able to go inside, but the architecture was stunning! Love the gothic style. We walked around the area a bit more and randomly stumbled on a rock festival, which was entertaining. From our brief visit, I really liked Palma, especially all the narrow alleys lined with shops.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sóller">Sóller</h3>
<p>After Palma, we drove for an hour to the small town of Sóller. The road there passed through the longest tunnel I’ve ever been in; it must have taken at least 5 minutes to go through. I attempted to hold my breath, but quickly realized it was futile. Sóller was a very pretty little town nestled in the mountains. We parked and walked to the main square, where there was a traditional dance happening. There were maybe 50 people of all ages dancing in unison. We watched for at least 15 minutes, it would have been fun to be able to learn how to do it; they were all very good. The town square was also home to the Parroquia de Sant Bartomeu de Sóller. The architectural style felt very similar to Palma Cathedral, very pretty! Unfortunately, the restaurant we wanted to go to for tapas was fully booked, so we ended up at a place a few minutes from the main square. I ordered the beef cheek tacos. They were good, but nothing amazing. I would have rather had our homemade tacos from last night again.</p>

<section id="cork" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cork">Cork</h2>
<p>This was my third time visiting Cork, although I was too young to remember the first time, and the second time was just driving through. My main purpose for coming to Cork was to visit my grandmother, Breda! She grew up in the area and moved back full-time about a decade ago. Only staying one night was far too short of a visit with her but I was still glad to be able to visit. She lives in a cute little house near Ballincollig, about a half-hour drive from Cork city center. It was really nice to be able to sleep somewhere that wasn’t a hostel dorm room! I didn’t arrive in Cork until the late afternoon on Thursday so we didn’t really have time to sightseeing so we made the most of it on Friday. Started off on Friday with a Hop-on Hop-off bus. Normally I would never think of touring a city like this but it was actually pretty great. I got to see a lot of the Cork highlights in only an hour and a half. I think my favorite site was the Shandon Clock Tower, which the tour guide said was the largest 4-faced clock tower until Big Ben was built. When the tower was originally built the clock hands were made of wood and the locals called it the “Four-Faced Liar” because the hands would get blown in the wind and all tell a different time. After the bus tour, we walked around the University College Cork campus. Loved this campus, the original campus building was a beautiful old castle-looking building with a lot of nice green space. Next, we headed back to St.&nbsp;Patrick’s St, the central hub of Cork that traverses the Cork island. Breda grew up in the area and spent a lot of her life in Cork so she knew the history of almost every building and how it had changed in the last century! We spent the afternoon walking around Cork’s churches and cathedrals, including Saint Fin Barre’s Cathedral, St Peter’s, and the Irish Franciscans Church. Although we didn’t go inside, Saint Fin Barre’s Cathedral was one of my favorite cathedrals architecturally that I’ve seen in Europe.</p>

<p>Despite probably being the number one tourist attraction in Dublin I loved the Guinness Storehouse. For only 30 euros to visit the whole building with a free Guinness sample and pint it seemed like a pretty decent deal too. The whole storehouse is totally over the top with large exhibits dedicated to the ingredients, brewing process, advertising, and legacy of Guinness. I learned a surprising amount about the brewing of Guinness and loved the section about the advertising schemes, there were so many random goofy posters with animals. “Lovely day for a Guinness!”. The tour ended at the top of the Storehouse with fantastic views of Dublin. I definitely gained a new appreciation for Guinness as a company and am now a certified Guinness enjoyer!</p>

<p>Carson and I spent a solid hour and a half in St Patrick’s Cathedral, the National Cathedral of Ireland. There was a 10 euro admission fee but an audio tour of the Cathedral was included. The audio tour shared a lot of really interesting history of the Cathedral. My favorite part was all the old flags hung up to commemorate Irish soldiers and the Knights of St Patrick’s. There was also a lot of really great stained glass, I think the Irish churches have the most beautiful stained glass of anywhere I’ve been. Entertainingly the Cathedral probably wouldn’t be around today if it wasn’t for the 1860-1865 restoration funded by the Guinness family for the equivalent of 22 million euro today. Carson and I were joking that it seems like everything in Dublin is connected to Guinness somehow.</p>

<p>In Dublin, we stayed at the Abbey Court Hostel, definitely the strangest hostel I’ve been in yet. Every wall was covered in artwork and the place was a total maze, to get to our dorm room we had to walk through part of the women’s bathroom. It was $70 per night for a six-bed dorm room which was the cheapest we could find in Dublin, seems so crazy expensive compared to the $20-30 per night I’ve paid in other cities. The price did include free breakfast, although it was shitty, and a game room with foosball, table tennis, and pool which we had fun in.</p>

<p>We arrived a half hour early for our Guinness Storehouse tour so to kill some time we wandered over to a nearby park which ended up being great. The gardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham felt like something straight out of Game of Thrones with all the manicured hedges. We found a fun little bird that wanted to pose for a picture too.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning we had an hour to kill between the hostel check-out and when I had to take the bus to the airport so we decided to check out the National Gallery. Amazingly the Gallery is free for anyone and has a lot of really amazing art. I loved all the landscape paintings. I would highly recommend spending some time there if you have some time to kill in Dublin.</p>

<p>My favorite meal in Cork was at a quaint little restaurant called Scoozi. I got a prosciutto and arugula pizza that was tasty. The first night in Dublin Carson and I went to a delicious noodles place called Lee’s Charming Noodles, unfortunately, I didn’t get a picture. For lunch on Sunday we got poke bowls which might actually be the healthier meals I’ve had yet, and it tasted great. For dinner on Saturday we went to White Rabbit. The restaurant was hidden in the back of a convenience store but totally worth it, I got the chicken cup bop and loved it.</p>

<section id="the-highlights" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-highlights">The Highlights</h2>
<p>This weekend I flew to Rome for a far too brief trip to visit my friends from UW who came to visit for spring break. I was only in Rome for a little bit more than a day and a half but I’d say I made the most of it. Rome has by far the most highlights of European cities I’ve been to so far. So many iconic ruins to visit. That being said, I don’t think I could ever live there, too many people and it’s not the cleanest city.&nbsp;</p>
<section id="colosseum" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="colosseum">Colosseum</h3>
<p>This was my second time at the Colosseum and it was as entrancing as the first time. It’s amazing how well it’s stood the test of time, shout out Roman concrete. It was significantly more crowded than it was last time in 2021 at the tail end of the pandemic. I wish I had been able to go inside but I ran out of time to make it happen on this trip. My friends went inside on Monday after I had left and got their photo taken by Bo Nix, the quarterback for the Denver Broncos… small flex.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="pantheon" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pantheon">Pantheon</h3>
<p>We all agreed that this was the highlight of our time in Rome. I missed seeing the Pantheon last time I was in Rome and I’m super glad I got to see it this time. We were waiting in the long line to get in when we were approached by some tour guides who promised to get us in instantly and give us a private guided experience for only $10 ($15 total) more than regular admission. After some debating, we decided to go for it. Best decision! We probably avoided waiting in line for an extra hour and our tour guide was great, look up Jessica Coppola (<a href="mailto:jessicacoppola8@gmail.com">jessicacoppola8@gmail.com</a>) if you’re ever in Rome. It was fascinating to learn about how much effort went into building the Pantheon, from the many types of marble mined from all over the Roman Empire to the rolling of the pillars for hundreds of miles from mine to the final destination. Also shout out to Pope Boniface IV for saving the Pantheon from destruction when he restored it to use as his private place of worship. The Pantheon definitely cracks the top 3 coolest buildings I’ve seen in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="monument-of-vittorio-emanuele-ii" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monument-of-vittorio-emanuele-ii">Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II</h3>
<p>Really big fan of this monument, especially because it was free to go up and in. The views from the top of Rome were fantastic! Hard to imagine the amount of effort that went into lifting the 50 equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II into place on its pedestal.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="trajans-forum" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trajans-forum">Trajan’s Forum</h3>
<p>Not much to say about Trajan’s Forum, we found our there on the first night while wandering. Lots of cool old pillar ruins. Ancient ruins are so amazing.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="piazza-navona" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="piazza-navona">Piazza Navona</h3>
<p>Sant’Agnese in Agone Fountain in the center of the square was pretty but pales in comparison to the Trevi Fountain. I really liked the church next to the square, Sant’Agnese in Agone. The stone carvings inside depicting the evil doings of pagans were incredible, my favorite carvings of the trip.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="trevi-fountain" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trevi-fountain">Trevi Fountain</h3>
<p>The Trevi Fountain was as beautiful as the last time I saw it, although with way bigger crowds this time. It felt like we were in a club, constantly pushing our way through people. I did really like being able to go to the lower level right next to the fountain to take pictures.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="spanish-steps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spanish-steps">Spanish Steps</h3>
<p>The Spanish Steps were fine but overrated in my opinion, they’re just too crowded. Watching the Italian police constantly tell people not to sit down on the steps was very entertaining. I will say the view from the top of the steps was very pretty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As expected, I ate lots of pizza and pasta this weekend! Saturday night, we ate dinner in a cute restaurant called Hostaria al Boschetto. I ordered the fusilli with bacon, mushrooms, rocket, and cheese. I forgot how much I had missed fresh pasta. I definitely need to make some this summer! On Sunday we got lunch at Bona Pizza. The place was packed but counter service was quick, they had a bunch of premade slices to go. I got a delicious pepperoni slice and a weird potato and bacon slice that I ordered on accident but was still pretty good. I’m still taking the Innsbruck as the best pizza I’ve had while abroad though. Also on Sunday, we splurged for some gelato. I got vanilla and two different chocolate flavors. So delicious!</p>

<p>This was my first time flying on Wizz Air and Ryan Air. The advertisement in the Wizz Air backseat magazine for becoming a pilot in two years was a bit scary to see before takeoff but both flights went off without a hitch. I really like boarding and deboarding from the front and the back of the plane, it makes everything so much more efficient. I wish more airlines in the US would do the same.</p>

<p>This was possibly the weirdest experience I’ve had abroad yet. We all had to go to the bathroom near the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II. There was a group of Italian Police standing near where we were so we went up and asked for directions to the bathroom. I’m not sure if something was lost in translation or if they were just bored but we ended up getting escorted by one of the officers to the bathroom. He stopped traffic for us and had us walk down the middle of the road, it was so surreal. I wish we had gotten a picture with the officer but we were all too focused on getting to the bathroom.</p>

<p>I finally got a cool souvenir! I know I should probably have been getting postcards or keychains or something in the cities I’ve visited for sentimental reasons but nothing has really called to me. Then, on the way to the Colosseum, I walked past an artist selling his drawings and they grabbed my attention. Ended up buying a three-panel piece that I loved. I’m going to try to find similar artwork during future trips.</p>

<section id="battle-for-prague" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="battle-for-prague">Battle for Prague</h2>
<p>For most of the semester Česká Zemědělská Univerzita has nothing in the way of sports culture but wow did that change for the Battle of Prague. Once a semester the four main universities in Prague, Czech University of Life Sciences (ČZU), Czech Technical University (ČVUT), Charles University (UK), and the University of Economics (VŠE), come together for a tournament to determine the best team in Prague. During the fall semester play in games ČZU lost so we played for third place against VŠE this semester. Before the game, we all bought ČZU scarves to show our spirit. Some of us went early to the pregame parade to the stadium, complete with green hair spray, face paint, free beer, and a police escort. It was really entertaining to be walking with a bunch of Czech students and shouting chants without having any idea what they meant. At the stadium, we met up with the rest of the group and went into the stadium. We went to a ČZU game in February and were very disappointed by the lack of fan turnout and energy but tonight was completely different. The stadium was packed with fans from the four schools and energy was super high. I daresay there was more fan energy than at UW, or at least comparable to the UW student section at hockey games. We had a total blast even though ČZU was by far the worst team. We lost 4-2 and it was never a competition, I think the loss extends our losing streak to 9 games…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="munich">Munich</h2>
<p>We had a fun but rainy weekend of sightseeing in Munich. We took a morning Flixbus and arrived in Munich at 2. After checking into the Wombat hostel, which I can highly recommend, we headed out to see the sights. We visited Munich Cathedral, St Peter’s Cathedral, and the New Town Hall in Munich’s central square, Marienplatz. St Peter’s Cathedral was beautiful with gold statues and murals, and we were lucky enough to have a live choir performing while we were there. We also paid to climb up the south tower for fantastic views of Munich. The view of the New Town Hall from the top was incredible, such a unique-looking building. We climbed down in time to catch the last of the three daily clock shows. The buildup of bells chiming took a full 10 minutes before the show started but it was worth the wait. Life-sized figures reenact jousting and dancing scenes from Munich’s history. It knocked the Prague astronomical clock’s show out of the water. For dinner, we went to Hofbräuhaus which was the largest restaurant I have ever been in, there was easily seating for 1000 people. We enjoyed some beer steins and traditional German food, it was a good time. Day two was rainy all morning. We were cold and wet on our walk to Eisbachwelle to see the river surfers but it was well worth it. They were incredible. What a cool thing to be able to do in the middle of a big city like Munich. After watching for a while we migrated to a St Patrick’s Day festival with live music but we were all so cold that we left pretty quickly. Near the festival, we stopped at Theatine Church and St.&nbsp;Michael München. Theatine Church had incredible stone carvings throughout the church, I can’t imagine the amount of work that went into it. Overall I enjoyed Munich, it was nice to walk from our hostel to all of the famous buildings in under half an hour. The food was good but expensive compared to Prague. I wish we had gotten better weather but we got so spoiled in Innsbruck that we were due for a not-as-good weather weekend, and it really only rained for a few hours the whole time.</p>

<section id="innsbruck" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="innsbruck">Innsbruck</h2>
<p>Gonna be hard to top this weekend trip, Innsbruck is such a fantastic little city nestled in the Alps. Every time I’m in the mountains I’m blown away and question why I don’t live in a mountainous place all the time. Innsbruck is the kind of city I would love to live in when I’m older. Close to the mountains, not too big, relaxed culture, great public transport, and did I mention close to the mountains? We stayed at the Meininger Hotel in a six-person hostel room. It was super nice to have a room totally to ourselves to lay out all of our stinky skiing stuff at the end of the day. The hostel was across the street from the University of Innsbruck and the Inn River. I was very jealous. Every evening at sunset, students would sit on the side of the river, drink a beer, and chat. So naturally, we did the same the nights we were there. Everyone looked so happy and carefree, exactly my type of outdoor-loving people. Downtown Innsbruck was a fifteen-minute walk from the hostel and is super cute, but we really only went there to get food. The first night we went to Stiftskeller restaurant. I ordered a delicious mac and cheese dish, which even came with a salad! Prague could never. The food came in less than five minutes, it actually might have been the fastest restaurant service I’ve ever experienced. The second night we went to a pizza place called Trattoria-Pizzeria Due Sicilie. Such a cute little Italian place with great pizza and service for a pretty reasonable price by Innsbruck standards. Might have been my favorite meal to date. On the third night, we got takeaway burritos from Machete. The burritos were pretty average, I’ve had much better in Madison, but it was fun to eat along the river. I’m really hoping to be able to come back to Innsbruck in May to go hiking!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="skiing-at-schlick-2000">Skiing at Schlick 2000</h2>
<p>I love skiing in the Alps! We chose Schlick 2000 as our ski destination since it was an easy half-hour bus ride from Innsbruck. All in we spent $180 for two days of skiing and rentals which feels like a pretty great deal considering it would be more expensive to ski on crappy Midwest hills for the same amount of time. Schlick 2000 is hidden from the road by the crest of a smaller hill. It was amazing to take the gondola up and have the mountain and trails emerge in front of me. Schlick has 15 miles of groomed trails, which were starting to get repetitive by the end, but still a lot of fun, especially considering even the easiest trails near the gondola were the same difficulty as the hardest trails at the ski places I’ve been to near Madison. The most fun I had was skiing the off-piste routes with Aubrey. Lots of steep moguls and weaving around trees, it was a blast and I felt myself get more competent every run! I felt bad for the ski rental place because I put quite a few dents and scratches on my skis. Both days we skied were absolutely gorgeous. We had highs in the 40s and perfectly clear and sunny. I was skiing in only a sweatshirt and still was sweating. The snow wasn’t great, it was a weird combination of slushy at lower elevations and icy on the steeper runs near the top of the mountain. The off-piste snow was better, although a bit thin, and even the worst spots were totally manageable. One of the workers said they hadn’t gotten any snow since December, all of the snow was created. I think we might have gotten in on the last good weekend of skiing for the season.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="budapest">Budapest</h2>
<p>Budapest was amazing and a perfect destination for our first trip out of Czechia. The city felt very similar to Prague in a lot of respects. From a tourist perspective, Budapest has more things to do and visit than Prague since it’s a fair bit larger, but it lacks the quaintness that makes Prague so special. The public transportation was fantastic, possibly even better than Prague’s, which is a high bar to pass, and the metro stations were super unique looking. That being said, there were a lot more cars which noticeably detracted from my enjoyment. The architectural style of most of the buildings felt very similar, with lots of ornate buildings and red roofs. I find it very interesting that neither Prague nor Budapest has anything in the way of skyscrapers. Budapest technically has one but it would barely count by US standards. We stayed at the Maverick Central Market Hostel, which I can highly recommend. It was cheap, clean, a great location, and let us store our luggage for free before check-in.</p>

<p>After taking the overnight Flixbus from Prague, we arrived half asleep to Budapest at 6 am. Thankfully the thermal baths awaited us. Three hours soaking in warm pools and saunas was so delightful, I need to find something similar in Prague. I can highly recommend Lukacs Baths if you’re ever in Budapest, only $10 for the whole day! We spent the rest of the day sightseeing! First on the agenda was St.&nbsp;Stephen’s Basilica, I didn’t have time to go inside, but the outside was very impressive. Next up was the Hungarian Parliament Building, which I would put in the running for most beautiful parliament building in the world, especially when it’s lit up at night. From there we went to the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe. Tickets to go inside were $30, unfortunately, but we walked around the outside and read up on the building’s history. Last on the landmarks list for the day was the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, which looked like a castle, with a moat and everything. For dinner we went to a restaurant called Babka, I ordered the Jemen Goulash. It was delicious and the presentation was amazing.</p>

<p>Another packed day of Budapest sightseeing. We started with Budapest Castle. Learning about the history of the Siege of Budapest by the Soviets and Romanians at the end of World War II was sobering. I’m amazed at how well the city has recovered after having its population and buildings so decimated. We didn’t end up going into the Castle to the history museum, but the view of Budapest from the top was beautiful. We managed to be timed perfectly for the hourly changing of the guards, I like that ceremonial stuff like that still has a place. Next we visited the Church of Saint Matthias which is one of the most incredible buildings I’ve ever seen. The hexagon tiling on the roof and the golden interior was all so amazing. For sunset we went to Gellért Hill, which has beautiful bluffs that overlook the city center. We ended the night with a prosecco cruise. Unlimited prosecco and truffle pasta is a dangerous combination but we had a great time.</p>

<section id="hiking-trip" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hiking-trip">Hiking Trip</h2>
<p>On February 8th, ESN organized a hiking trip in the Czech countryside near Kamenný Přívoz village, about an hour’s train ride south of Prague (I love the train network here!!). We hiked seven miles following the Sázava river. The landscape reminded me a lot of Oregon, with rolling hills and bluffs, and lots of evergreens. Getting out of the city on a hike and talking with other CZU students was great! My favorite part was the small houses built on the side of the bluffs! I have no idea how they get down to their houses, let alone how they built them. It looked like such a peaceful life living on the river, I’m envious. I want to do more hiking day trips around Czechia, Bohemian Switzerland National Park might be next.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kutná-hora">Kutná Hora</h2>
<p>On February 16, our group took a day trip to Kutná Hora, which was also just an hour away by train (I promise I’ll stop praising the trains eventually). Kutná Hora is known for the Sedlec Ossuary, also called the Bone Church. The inside of the church is pretty incredible, there are pyramid stacks and hanging arrangements built from thousands of bones of people from the 14th and 15th centuries who died from the bubonic plague and Hussite Wars. We also visited the Cathedral of Assumption of Our Lady and St.&nbsp;John the Baptist. The interior had a lot of beautiful murals and gold statues. I love all of the old churches and cathedrals in Europe, even the ones in small towns are so amazingly intricate.</p>

<p>Everyone I’ve met here is so friendly and fun! There are ten of us from UW living in Dormitory JIH so we quickly became good friends.

<p>The ESN organized events have been a great way to meet other international students! During the first events, we met a great group of French who have quickly become our closest non-American friends. Artemis from Greece has also joined our close circle, and came with us to Budapest last weekend! I’ve also become friends with people from Germany, Austria, South Korea, Turkey and Brazil! Many of them live at the external dormitory, which is half an hour from campus, so it can be difficult to make plans, but it’s fun to see them at classes and ESN events. I haven’t met any Czechs yet, the ESN events aren’t geared towards Czech students and my classes are mainly international students. I have embarrassingly few group pictures with everyone, I’ll have to work on that.</p>

The Soviets would paid over the wall frequently but the wall would be filled with paintings and inspirational messages the very next day. Our tour guide said that now they host poem days where they string up paper and anyone can come and share a poem for others to read.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Prague is amazing! I’m sure anyone who’s visited here feels the same, it really is a magical city. I love the architecture and the cobbled streets. Everything feels like it has so much more character and life than anywhere in the US.</p>
<section id="public-transport" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-transport">Public Transport</h2>
<p>I think my favorite part about Prague might be the public transport. With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.</p>

<p>So far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.</p>

<section id="drinking-culture" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drinking-culture">Drinking Culture</h2>
<p>It’s hard to talk about Prague without talking about beer. Seriously, it feels like nearly everything I do in Prague involves drinking. It’s easy to see how Czechia has by far the highest beer consumption of any country. The get-to-know-you events (human bingo, trivia, tour of Prague) for students studying abroad put on by the European Student Network either took place at a bar or ended at one. Even the dorms on campus have bars on the ground floor, not to mention the CZU club. It’s very jarring to see the heavy drinking culture in Madison get outmatched almost instantly in Prague. That being said, there is plenty to do in Prague that doesn’t involve drinking, it’s just harder to find places to hang out that aren’t bars than I would like.</p>

<section id="food" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="food">Food</h2>
<p>The food in Prague has been great so far, and more importantly it’s cheap! I try to cook as many of my meals as I can, but when I go out, most of the places are $7 or less for a full meal, although we mostly end up going to chains. Some of my favorites include Bageterie Boulevard, a Czech chain that serves delicious warm baguette sandwiches, Vietfood, which serves surprisingly good Vietnamese and other asian dishes, and any kebab shop we can find. I think kebabs make up half of the meals I’ve eaten in Prague, and that’s not even that much of an exaggeration. Kebab in Prague means a tortilla filled with gyro meat, cabbage, lettuce, onion, garlic sauce, and chilli sauce wrapped up like a burrito. There are kebab shops all over Prague, it’s just too easy and delicious to pass up.</p>

</div>
<p>Embarrassingly, I’ve only gotten Czech food one time, and while it was pretty decent, there’s a good reason Czechia isn’t known for its cuisine. I want to go out for Czech food again in the future, but it’s just so convenient to go to my standbys of Bageterie Boulevard, Vietfood, or kebab.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Hello from Prague! This is my third week in Prague and I’m starting to feel pretty settled in so I decided it’s time to do my first blog post! The last three weeks have been a blur, it simultaneously feels like I’ve been here for no time at all and also multiple months. I’m going to try to post weekly forward, but I’m going to be playing catch up for the last few weeks first.</p>
<section id="czu" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="czu">CZU</h2>
<p>I’m spending my semester abroad at the Czech University of Life Sciences (Česká Zemědělská Univerzita in Czech). The university is in Prague 6, about seven miles from the city center, which ends up being around a half hour away on public transport. The campus itself is pretty small, especially compared to the sprawling University of Wisconsin I’m used to. It’s nice to have all my classes within a quick 7-minute walk, and for the campus to be mostly car-free. There are around 20,000 students who study at CZU, but it honestly feels a fair bit smaller. My largest class only has like 15 students. The campus buildings feel new, or at least recently remodeled, with nice classrooms and layouts. Because the university is geared towards agriculture and environmental students, there’s a good amount of greenspace and even a small farm with llamas!</p>

<section id="classes" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classes">Classes</h2>
<p>Classes themselves are probably the biggest letdown of the whole experience so far. I’m used to the rigor of UW classes so it’s jarring to only meet for classes once a week for an hour and a half lecture, and then have virtually no assignments to do between classes. While at CZU I’m in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and am taking all ecology courses: Wetland Conservation and Management, Forest Ecology, Non-forest Vegetation, and Ecosystem Conservation and Management. Two of my courses have twenty-minute presentations as the only assignment besides the final, another one has some short readings. My last class doesn’t have any assignments, just a couple of half-day field trips, which hopefully are a good experience. It’s nice to have more free time than in Madison, but I am quickly realizing that I need the consistency of assignments to occupy my days and make me feel like I’m doing something productive. The lectures do teach a fair bit of information, but without assignments, I don’t think very much of it will sink in. I’m just hoping I take some knowledge away from the semester so the courses aren’t a total waste.</p>

<section id="dorms" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dorms">Dorms</h2>
<p>The dorms here are less than ideal. I know all dorms are pretty bad, but these seem even worse than where I stayed for freshman year at UW. There are no common rooms, just a very cramped room with a ping-pong table. The dorm rooms are reasonably big but the linoleum floor collects dust like nobody’s business. We share a bathroom with two people in the room next door, which isn’t too bad, but the bathroom looks like it hasn’t been updated since the 50s and all the cabinets are rusted shut. It’s all manageable because the room costs less than $300 per month, but we know people in the same dorm who have a brand new updated bathroom despite paying the same, so we’re salty. The one good thing I can say about the bathroom is that the water pressure and heat are top notch. For cooking, the dorm room comes with a mini fridge and small hot plate, which just barely does the job. I’ve been able to make breakfast burritos, pasta, and curry, but only having one burner feels very limiting. Thankfully the grocery store is only a 10 minute bus ride away and I shop multiple times per week so the mini fridge isn’t too restrictive.</p>
