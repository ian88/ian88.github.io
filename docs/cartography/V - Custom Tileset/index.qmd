For this project, I created a custom tileset in MapBox Studio based on V for Vendetta, a 1982 graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd, and the 2005 film adaptation, directed by James McTeigue.

The tileset uses fonts and colors drawn directly from the graphic novel and film to mimic the muted, noir aesthetic of V for Vendetta. Additionally, I brought in pictorial elements from the graphic novel, including the Guy Faux mask as a city indicator and an explosion to cover the city's extent. More details on the design choices I implemented can be found in the explainer below.
