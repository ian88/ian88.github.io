With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decent to the metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe buses to campus can be absolutely packed during the school day but thankfully they come every five minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are cables for the trams everywhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many train tracks from the central station!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the train on the way back from a hike"

I want to go out for Czech food again in the future, but it’s just so convenient to go to my standbys of Bageterie Boulevard, Vietfood, or kebab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCzech food!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCzech dinner with study abroad friends!"

We didn’t end up going into the Castle to the history museum, but the view of Budapest from the top was beautiful. We managed to be timed perfectly for the hourly changing of the guards, I like that ceremonial stuff like that still has a place. Next we visited the Church of Saint Matthias which is one of the most incredible buildings I’ve ever seen. The hexagon tiling on the roof and the golden interior was all so amazing.

All in we spent $180 for two days of skiing and rentals which feels like a pretty great deal considering it would be more expensive to ski on crappy Midwest hills for the same amount of time. Schlick 2000 is hidden from the road by the crest of a smaller hill. It was amazing to take the gondola up and have the mountain and trails emerge in front of me. Schlick has 15 miles of groomed trails, which were starting to get repetitive by the end, but still a lot of fun, especially considering even the easiest trails near the gondola were the same difficulty as the hardest trails at the ski places I’ve been to near Madison. The most fun I had was skiing the off-piste routes with Aubrey. Lots of steep moguls and weaving around trees, it was a blast and I felt myself get more competent every run! I felt bad for the ski rental place because I put quite a few dents and scratches on my skis. Both days we skied were absolutely gorgeous. We had highs in the 40s and perfectly clear and sunny. I was skiing in only a sweatshirt and still was sweating. The snow wasn’t great, it was a weird combination of slushy at lower elevations and icy on the steeper runs near the top of the mountain. The off-piste snow was better, although a bit thin, and even the worst spots were totally manageable. One of the workers said they hadn’t gotten any snow since December, all of the snow was created. I think we might have gotten in on the last good weekend of skiing for the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of Schlick 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe skiing group!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfi at Panorama bar at the top of the mountain.

Once a semester the four main universities in Prague, Czech University of Life Sciences (ČZU), Czech Technical University (ČVUT), Charles University (UK), and the University of Economics (VŠE), come together for a tournament to determine the best team in Prague. During the fall semester play in games ČZU lost so we played for third place against VŠE this semester. Before the game, we all bought ČZU scarves to show our spirit. Some of us went early to the pregame parade to the stadium, complete with green hair spray, face paint, free beer, and a police escort. It was really entertaining to be walking with a bunch of Czech students and shouting chants without having any idea what they meant. At the stadium, we met up with the rest of the group and went into the stadium.

    "text": "For most of the semester Česká Zemědělská Univerzita has nothing in the way of sports culture but wow did that change for the Battle of Prague. Once a semester the four main universities in Prague, Czech University of Life Sciences (ČZU), Czech Technical University (ČVUT), Charles University (UK), and the University of Economics (VŠE), come together for a tournament to determine the best team in Prague. During the fall semester play in games ČZU lost so we played for third place against VŠE this semester. Before the game, we all bought ČZU scarves to show our spirit. Some of us went early to the pregame parade to the stadium, complete with green hair spray, face paint, free beer, and a police escort. It was really entertaining to be walking with a bunch of Czech students and shouting chants without having any idea what they meant.

    "text": "Munich\nWe had a fun but rainy weekend of sightseeing in Munich. We took a morning Flixbus and arrived in Munich at 2. After checking into the Wombat hostel, which I can highly recommend, we headed out to see the sights. We visited Munich Cathedral, St Peter’s Cathedral, and the New Town Hall in Munich’s central square, Marienplatz. St Peter’s Cathedral was beautiful with gold statues and murals, and we were lucky enough to have a live choir performing while we were there. We also paid to climb up the south tower for fantastic views of Munich. The view of the New Town Hall from the top was incredible, such a unique-looking building. We climbed down in time to catch the last of the three daily clock shows. The buildup of bells chiming took a full 10 minutes before the show started but it was worth the wait. Life-sized figures reenact jousting and dancing scenes from Munich’s history. It knocked the Prague astronomical clock’s show out of the water. For dinner, we went to Hofbräuhaus which was the largest restaurant I have ever been in, there was easily seating for 1000 people. We enjoyed some beer steins and traditional German food, it was a good time. Day two was rainy all morning. We were cold and wet on our walk to Eisbachwelle to see the river surfers but it was well worth it. They were incredible. What a cool thing to be able to do in the middle of a big city like Munich. After watching for a while we migrated to a St Patrick’s Day festival with live music but we were all so cold that we left pretty quickly. Near the festival, we stopped at Theatine Church and St. Michael München. Theatine Church had incredible stone carvings throughout the church, I can’t imagine the amount of work that went into it. Overall I enjoyed Munich, it was nice to walk from our hostel to all of the famous buildings in under half an hour. The food was good but expensive compared to Prague. I wish we had gotten better weather but we got so spoiled in Innsbruck that we were due for a not-as-good weather weekend, and it really only rained for a few hours the whole time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived in Munich!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarienplatz Square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New Town Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of St. Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic View of Munich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying some steins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWet morning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe surfers were so cool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Theatine Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St Michael’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo close to a perfect split the G, happy St Patrick’s Day weekend!"

I ordered the fusilli with bacon, mushrooms, rocket, and cheese. I forgot how much I had missed fresh pasta. I definitely need to make some this summer! On Sunday we got lunch at Bona Pizza. The place was packed but counter service was quick, they had a bunch of premade slices to go. I got a delicious pepperoni slice and a weird potato and bacon slice that I ordered on accident but was still pretty good. I’m still taking the Innsbruck as the best pizza I’ve had while abroad though. Also on Sunday, we splurged for some gelato. I got vanilla and two different chocolate flavors.

The advertisement in the Wizz Air backseat magazine for becoming a pilot in two years was a bit scary to see before takeoff but both flights went off without a hitch. I really like boarding and deboarding from the front and the back of the plane, it makes everything so much more efficient. I wish more airlines in the US would do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding for Wizz Air\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 year pilot program…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding for Ryanair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItalian Police Escort\nThis was possibly the weirdest experience I’ve had abroad yet. We all had to go to the bathroom near the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II. There was a group of Italian Police standing near where we were so we went up and asked for directions to the bathroom. I’m not sure if something was lost in translation or if they were just bored but we ended up getting escorted by one of the officers to the bathroom. He stopped traffic for us and had us walk down the middle of the road, it was so surreal. I wish we had gotten a picture with the officer but we were all too focused on getting to the bathroom.\n\n\nSouvenir\nI finally got a cool souvenir! I know I should probably have been getting postcards or keychains or something in the cities I’ve visited for sentimental reasons but nothing has really called to me. Then, on the way to the Colosseum, I walked past an artist selling his drawings and they grabbed my attention. Ended up buying a three-panel piece that I loved. I’m going to try to find similar artwork during future trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelt like a fever dream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this simple style"

My main purpose for coming to Cork was to visit my grandmother, Breda! She grew up in the area and moved back full-time about a decade ago. Only staying one night was far too short of a visit with her but I was still glad to be able to visit. She lives in a cute little house near Ballincollig, about a half-hour drive from Cork city center. It was really nice to be able to sleep somewhere that wasn’t a hostel dorm room! I didn’t arrive in Cork until the late afternoon on Thursday so we didn’t really have time to sightseeing so we made the most of it on Friday. Started off on Friday with a Hop-on Hop-off bus. Normally I would never think of touring a city like this but it was actually pretty great. I got to see a lot of the Cork highlights in only an hour and a half. I think my favorite site was the Shandon Clock Tower, which the tour guide said was the largest 4-faced clock tower until Big Ben was built. When the tower was originally built the clock hands were made of wood and the locals called it the “Four-Faced Liar” because the hands would get blown in the wind and all tell a different time. After the bus tour, we walked around the University College Cork campus. Loved this campus, the original campus building was a beautiful old castle-looking building with a lot of nice green space. Next, we headed back to St. Patrick’s St, the central hub of Cork that traverses the Cork island. Breda grew up in the area and spent a lot of her life in Cork so she knew the history of almost every building and how it had changed in the last century! We spent the afternoon walking around Cork’s churches and cathedrals, including Saint Fin Barre’s Cathedral, St Peter’s, and the Irish Franciscans Church.

    "text": "Dublin\n\nGuinness Storehouse\nDespite probably being the number one tourist attraction in Dublin I loved the Guinness Storehouse. For only 30 euros to visit the whole building with a free Guinness sample and pint it seemed like a pretty decent deal too. The whole storehouse is totally over the top with large exhibits dedicated to the ingredients, brewing process, advertising, and legacy of Guinness. I learned a surprising amount about the brewing of Guinness and loved the section about the advertising schemes, there were so many random goofy posters with animals. “Lovely day for a Guinness!”. The tour ended at the top of the Storehouse with fantastic views of Dublin. I definitely gained a new appreciation for Guinness as a company and am now a certified Guinness enjoyer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrazy water display, the glasses are just made up of falling water droplets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure how one becomes a yeast mega fan but I’m all for it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying a free Guinness at the end of the tour, once again I failed to split the G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoofy advertising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral\nCarson and I spent a solid hour and a half in St Patrick’s Cathedral, the National Cathedral of Ireland. There was a 10 euro admission fee but an audio tour of the Cathedral was included. The audio tour shared a lot of really interesting history of the Cathedral. My favorite part was all the old flags hung up to commemorate Irish soldiers and the Knights of St Patrick’s. There was also a lot of really great stained glass, I think the Irish churches have the most beautiful stained glass of anywhere I’ve been. Entertainingly the Cathedral probably wouldn’t be around today if it wasn’t for the 1860-1865 restoration funded by the Guinness family for the equivalent of 22 million euro today. Carson and I were joking that it seems like everything in Dublin is connected to Guinness somehow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Patrick’s Knights, I love these old flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful stained glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper cool spiral staircase to the organ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI swear everything in Dublin is connected to Guinness somehow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\nAbbey Court Hostel\nIn Dublin, we stayed at the Abbey Court Hostel, definitely the strangest hostel I’ve been in yet. Every wall was covered in artwork and the place was a total maze, to get to our dorm room we had to walk through part of the women’s bathroom. It was $70 per night for a six-bed dorm room which was the cheapest we could find in Dublin, seems so crazy expensive compared to the $20-30 per night I’ve paid in other cities. The price did include free breakfast, although it was shitty, and a game room with foosball, table tennis, and pool which we had fun in.\n\n\nGardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham\nWe arrived a half hour early for our Guinness Storehouse tour so to kill some time we wandered over to a nearby park which ended up being great. The gardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham felt like something straight out of Game of Thrones with all the manicured hedges. We found a fun little bird that wanted to pose for a picture too.\n\n\nNational Gallery of Ireland\nOn Sunday morning we had an hour to kill between the hostel check-out and when I had to take the bus to the airport so we decided to check out the National Gallery. Amazingly the Gallery is free for anyone and has a lot of really amazing art. I loved all the landscape paintings. I would highly recommend spending some time there if you have some time to kill in Dublin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hostel walls were covered in artwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoosball!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDublin Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle bird was posing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite paintings from the National Gallery"

The restaurant was hidden in the back of a convenience store but totally worth it, I got the chicken cup bop and loved it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza from Scoozi!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoke from Nutbutter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken cupbap from White Rabbit"

    "text": "This was my third time visiting Cork, although I was too young to remember the first time, and the second time was just driving through. My main purpose for coming to Cork was to visit my grandmother, Breda! She grew up in the area and moved back full-time about a decade ago. Only staying one night was far too short of a visit with her but I was still glad to be able to visit. She lives in a cute little house near Ballincollig, about a half-hour drive from Cork city center. It was really nice to be able to sleep somewhere that wasn’t a hostel dorm room! I didn’t arrive in Cork until the late afternoon on Thursday so we didn’t really have time to sightseeing so we made the most of it on Friday. Started off on Friday with a Hop-on Hop-off bus. Normally I would never think of touring a city like this but it was actually pretty great. I got to see a lot of the Cork highlights in only an hour and a half. I think my favorite site was the Shandon Clock Tower, which the tour guide said was the largest 4-faced clock tower until Big Ben was built. When the tower was originally built the clock hands were made of wood and the locals called it the “Four-Faced Liar” because the hands would get blown in the wind and all tell a different time. After the bus tour, we walked around the University College Cork campus. Loved this campus, the original campus building was a beautiful old castle-looking building with a lot of nice green space. Next, we headed back to St. Patrick’s St, the central hub of Cork that traverses the Cork island. Breda grew up in the area and spent a lot of her life in Cork so she knew the history of almost every building and how it had changed in the last century! We spent the afternoon walking around Cork’s churches and cathedrals, including Saint Fin Barre’s Cathedral, St Peter’s, and the Irish Franciscans Church. Although we didn’t go inside, Saint Fin Barre’s Cathedral was one of my favorite cathedrals architecturally that I’ve seen in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreda!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI climbed this tree when I was 3, unfotunately it isn’t doing so well now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the hop-on hop-off bus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Fin Barre’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Irish Franciscans Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original UCC building is amazing, I would love to take a class there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of nice green space on the UCC campus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCork Coat of Arms, love this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShandon Clock Tower"

    "text": "Friday\nBig day of beach hopping!\n\nCaló des Moro\nUnfortunately, one of our rental cars got rear-ended on the way to the beach, but thankfully, we had paid for full insurance coverage, and only the license plate was damaged. Caló des Moro was gorgeous! The water was crystal clear, and cliffs jutted out into the ocean. Reminded me a bit of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula. There were people cliff jumping on the other side of the beach, so naturally we had to join in. The cliff was only like ten feet above the water, but it was such a blast. We only went in twice, though, because it was cold and windy when we got out. Honestly, the water felt warmer than the air. We still ended up hanging out for a long while and even ate lunch there. After we walked around one of the cliffs to another beautiful beach. The whole area was managed by a local family, which I think is great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallorca is stunning!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff jumping!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mallorca group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaló des Moro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Caragol\nThis beach was a bit of a nightmare to get to. Google Maps had no idea that the route it wanted us to take involved private, gated-off roads. It took us a lot of tries to figure out where to go. At one point, we found ourselves on a narrow one-lane dirt road that abruptly dead-ended. We had to do a 25-point turn to get back on track. Half an hour later, we finally made it to the beach. It was a half-mile walk along the coast to the beach from the parking lot. Cabrera Island was visible in the distance the whole time. It would be interesting to visit at some point since I think it’s all a national park. We didn’t actually make it to the beach because we found a fun rock outcropping with some old stone structures to explore. And no one was in the mood to swim with the cool weather and wind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot ourselves into a bit of a jam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabrera Island in the distance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA strange sight on the beach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEs Pontàs and Cala Santanyi\nI loved the Es Pontàs arch! Such a cool natural formation, I was surprised it wasn’t more crowded at the lookout point. Cala Sanranyi was the most touristy of the beaches we visited today. There were a lot of hotels built right next to it. Luckily, it wasn’t crowded. We lay out on towels for an hour until it got too cold. The only person swimming was a small kid who was having fun trying to jump over the waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEs Pontàs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArch pic with Peter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking\nForgot how much I missed cooking in a proper kitchen!

    "text": "Saturday\n\nBoat cruise\nMost of today was spent on a boat cruise through Magic Catamarans! It was fantastic to spend so much time on the water, but it was very cold. The weather was overcast most of the day, and there was a lot of wind on the boat. We hung out in mesh at the front of the boat the whole time. They offered snorkeling equipment, which we were stoked about before the cruise, but after getting whipped around by the cold wind, no one was excited about jumping in the water, and there wasn’t anything to see underwater either. We were served a decent lunch with a kebab, chicken breast, brat, and salad. They also gave out glasses of sangria, which helped take the chill off. Warmer weather and sun would have made it a better experience, but we still had a great time, hard to complain when you’re on the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatamaran!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone on the boat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved laying on the netting but it was chilly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoat lunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalma\nWe finished the cruise at around 3 and headed into the Palma city center. We got our souvenir shopping out of the way and visited Palma Cathedral. We weren’t able to go inside, but the architecture was stunning! Love the gothic style. We walked around the area a bit more and randomly stumbled on a rock festival, which was entertaining. From our brief visit, I really liked Palma, especially all the narrow alleys lined with shops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the trees lining this street\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalma Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the architecture of the Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSóller\nAfter Palma, we drove for an hour to the small town of Sóller. The road there passed through the longest tunnel I’ve ever been in; it must have taken at least 5 minutes to go through. I attempted to hold my breath, but quickly realized it was futile. Sóller was a very pretty little town nestled in the mountains. We parked and walked to the main square, where there was a traditional dance happening. There were maybe 50 people of all ages dancing in unison. We watched for at least 15 minutes, it would have been fun to be able to learn how to do it; they were all very good. The town square was also home to the Parroquia de Sant Bartomeu de Sóller. The architectural style felt very similar to Palma Cathedral, very pretty! Unfortunately, the restaurant we wanted to go to for tapas was fully booked, so we ended up at a place a few minutes from the main square. I ordered the beef cheek tacos. They were good, but nothing amazing. I would have rather had our homemade tacos from last night again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParroquia de Sant Bartomeu de Sóller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional dancing in the town square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef cheek tacos"

We had heard that Vienna was expensive, so we decided to stay in Bratislava Friday and Saturday nights but do a day trip to Vienna because it’s only an hour and a half away. It may have been cheaper, but staying in Vienna at least one, if not both nights would have been much more enjoyable. There’s just so much more to do, especially for nightlife, and taking the bus to and from Vienna was kinda annoying. We decided that we were glad to check Bratislava off the travel list, but that it was a one-and-done destination."

    "text": "Bratislava Friday\nWe took the Můj Vlak train to Bratislava from Prague and arrived at 2 pm. It was a nice change of pace to take a train instead of a bus. Technically, we had assigned seats, but we wanted a table to play cards together, so we would pitch up in a spot and then move when someone kicked us out. Bratislava felt like a ghost town. Maybe it was the rainy weather, but there was hardly anyone outside, which felt strange compared to the other cities we visited. We checked into our hostel for the weekend, Patio Hostel. It was nice to have private dorm rooms, but the hostel was pretty lacking; the bathrooms were still shared with the rest of the floor, and it felt like we were the only ones under the age of 40. Maybe Bratislava doesn’t get a lot of young tourists, or maybe we just messed up and picked a hostel that caters to older travelers. But it was cheap and we didn’t have to spend much time there, so I can’t complain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived in Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery cool map of old Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool water pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUFO Tower\nThe UFO Tower was our first stop in Bratislava. It was $11 to go up to the observation deck, which felt a bit overpriced, but the view was fantastic. The wind was blowing strongly, but at least it stopped raining. We had a full 360 panorama of Bratislava and the surrounding area. Bratislava looked like it had three distinct areas. An older area which looked more similar to the area around Prague Castle, the downtown with skyscrapers, and the residential area with dozens of copy-paste Soviet-style apartment buildings. It was strange to see skyscrapers after not having any in Prague or Budapest, considering how culturally similar they are. There were a lot of small river cruise ships. I think a cruise down the Danube from Vienna to Budapest, passing through Bratislava and small towns, would be interesting. I liked how much green there was on the west side of the river, and northwest of the city, there were over a hundred wind turbines. The UFO tower is apparently part of the World Federation of Great Towers, joining the Space Needle, Eiffel Tower, Burj Khalifa, Sears Tower, and many more, although it didn’t really feel as worthy of the honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinately looks like a UFO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView of Western Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView of Eastern Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCold and windy group photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBratislava Castle\nOur second stop of the day was the Bratislava Castle. On the way, we stopped at St. Martin’s Cathedral, which was very large but not as ornate as a lot of the other Cathedrals I’ve visited. It feels blasphemous to say, but I think I prefer Bratislava Castle to Prague Castle, although if I’m including the Cathedral in the center of Prague Castle, then it probably gets the edge. The Castle also had a nice view of the city. We walked around the outside a bit, but the inner courtyard was closed, so we decided to leave and come back on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBratislava Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGardens in the back of the castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner\nFor dinner, we went to the Slovak Pub, which came highly recommended online. I ordered the potato pierogi, which was fine but not exceptional. They didn’t have the 1L beers like we had been told, and the service wasn’t great, so overall we weren’t too impressed. Maybe we went on a bad night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner at the Slovak Pub"

    "text": "Vienna Saturday\nWe took the RegioJet bus to Vienna at 7:30 am this morning. We beelined for breakfast first. All of the cafes that were recommended to us had huge lines, but we ended up at a place called Stadtcafe, and I got a delicious breakfast sandwich. First stops after that were St Peter’s Cathedral and the Sisi Museum. The architecture of Vienna is amazing! Behind the Museum was a huge open area with a lot of museums. There were some people playing spikeball, so of course Peter and I asked to join for a game. They had cleats and Spikeball jerseys, and we got destroyed, but it was a blast. I love how Vienna has public water filling locations scattered around the city; more places in Europe need to do this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St. Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe St. Peter’s organ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSisi Museum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince Eugene Monument\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikeball!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Stephen’s\nSt. Stephen’s is definitely the flagship of Vienna. I loved the Gothic architecture style, with so much intricate detail. The interior was huge with lots of amazing stone carvings. We wanted to go up into one of the towers, but the admission fee was cash only, and not everyone had enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Stephen’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelvedere\nI loved the Belevdere Palace! Really beautiful gardens to walk through and enjoy. The view across the reservoir to the Palace was amazing. Unfortunately, the museum was sold out of tickets for the day so I’ll have to come back another time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelvedere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower Belvedere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup pic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHundertwasser House\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like the Hundertwasser House. The architectural style felt a bit like a post-apocalyptic apartment complex. I’m curious if anyone actually lives in the apartments or if it’s mainly just a tourist attraction. There was a large gift shop building too, I was so tempted to get one of the matted paintings, but $50 was a bit more than I wanted to spend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Stephen’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner\nFor whatever reason, we decided to trust Tristan with finding a place for dinner. He made a reservation for Chez Bernard, which was quite a bit fancier than we were used to. The restaurant was on the 7th floor of a nice hotel. The meal was $45 a person for a main dish and a beer. The food was very good, but I was definitely not ready to be paying so much for it. The restaurant also added a $5 per person place setting charge, which apparently is common for upscale Austrian restaurants, but I had never seen that before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken and austrian gnocci\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitzcarraldo Speakeasy\nAfter dinner, we headed to a speakeasy that Tristan was obsessed with finding. To get in, we had to press a button on a vending machine, and the speakeasy was hidden behind it. The place was very small and dim, but the atmosphere was perfect. All the tables were reserved, but they had space for us to stand at the bar, which turned out to be much more fun because we could watch the bartenders make the fancy drinks. Rafe and I ordered the Elyx Gimlet, which came on top of a rock holder with a light underneath. The drink started bright purple, but then the bartender poured in something that turned the whole drink neon green. Peter and Violette ordered a drink that came with a foot-tall tower of bubbles that they had to eat before getting to the actual drink. Paying $18 after spending so much on dinner was not great, but for the experience, it was worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVending machine entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the speakeasy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy neon green drink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nSo cool to watch them make it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nPeter had fun with this one"

They sold very similar stuff, lots of kielbasa, shish kebabs, jewelry, and hot wine, but it was great to hang out on such a beautiful day.

On Easter Monday, Czech boys collect willow branches and braid them together to create a whip. They decorate the whip with ribbons and then whip girls. The whipping is supposed to bring the girls good luck and fertility. Predecorated whips were being sold at all of the Easter Markets and even on campus. From what I saw, the tradition isn’t really done anymore in Prague; the selling of whips is more just honoring the history of the tradition at this point."
