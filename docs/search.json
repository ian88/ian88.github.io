With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decent to the metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe buses to campus can be absolutely packed during the school day but thankfully they come every five minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are cables for the trams everywhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many train tracks from the central station!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the train on the way back from a hike"

The inside of the church is pretty incredible, there are pyramid stacks and hanging arrangements built from thousands of bones of people from the 14th and 15th centuries who died from the bubonic plague and Hussite Wars. We also visited the Cathedral of Assumption of Our Lady and St. John the Baptist. The interior had a lot of beautiful murals and gold statues.

We spent the rest of the day sightseeing! First on the agenda was St. Stephen’s Basilica, I didn’t have time to go inside, but the outside was very impressive. Next up was the Hungarian Parliament Building, which I would put in the running for most beautiful parliament building in the world, especially when it’s lit up at night. From there we went to the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe. Tickets to go inside were $30, unfortunately, but we walked around the outside and read up on the building’s history. Last on the landmarks list for the day was the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, which looked like a castle, with a moat and everything.

Learning about the history of the Siege of Budapest by the Soviets and Romanians at the end of World War II was sobering. I’m amazed at how well the city has recovered after having its population and buildings so decimated. We didn’t end up going into the Castle to the history museum, but the view of Budapest from the top was beautiful. We managed to be timed perfectly for the hourly changing of the guards, I like that ceremonial stuff like that still has a place. Next we visited the Church of Saint Matthias which is one of the most incredible buildings I’ve ever seen. The hexagon tiling on the roof and the golden interior was all so amazing. For sunset we went to Gellért Hill, which has beautiful bluffs that overlook the city center. We ended the night with a prosecco cruise.

All in we spent $180 for two days of skiing and rentals which feels like a pretty great deal considering it would be more expensive to ski on crappy midwest hills for the same amount of time. Schlick 2000 is hidden from the road by the crest of a smaller hill. It was amazing to take the gondola up and have the mountain and trails emerge in front of me. Schlick has 15 miles of groomed trails, which were starting to get repetitive by the end, but still a lot of fun, especially considering even the easiest trails near the gondola were the same difficulty as the hardest trails at the ski places I’ve been to near Madison. The most fun I had was skiing the off-piste routes with Aubrey. Lots of steep moguls and weaving around trees, it was a blast and I felt myself get more competent every run! I felt bad for the ski rental place because I put quite a few dents and scratches on my skis. Both days we skied were absolute gorgeous. We had highs in the 40s and perfectly clear and sunny. I was skiing in only a sweatshirt and still was sweating. The snow wasn’t great, it was a weird combination of slushy at lower elevations and icy on the steeper runs near the top of the mountain. The off-piste snow was better, although a bit thin, and even the worst spots were totally manageable. One of the workers said they hadn’t gotten any snow since December, all of the snow was created. I think we might have gotten in on the last good weekend of skiing for the season before more of the snow melts and the off-piste routes become too bare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of Schlick 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe skiing group!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfi at Panorama bar at the top of the mountain.
