With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decent to the metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe buses to campus can be absolutely packed during the school day but thankfully they come every five minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are cables for the trams everywhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many train tracks from the central station!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the train on the way back from a hike"

I think kebabs make up half of the meals I’ve eaten in Prague, and that’s not even that much of an exaggeration.

    "text": "Prague Castle\nProbably the most famous building in Prague. The Castle itself I found a little underwhelming because in my head castle mean medieval castle with turrets and a moat. That being said St. Vitus Cathedral in the central of the castle is beautiful and the view of Prague from the castle is incredible! I’ll have to go back at some point and pay to go inside the castle to see the museum and photo gallery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView from the front of Prague Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrague Cathedral inside the center countyard of the castle"

    "text": "Lennon Wall\nProbably the coolest mural wall I’ve seen. So much history in one place. The tradition of painting the wall started during the Soviet oppression of Czechia as a way to defy Soviet control. The Soviets would paid over the wall frequently but the wall would be filled with paintings and inspirational messages the very next day. Our tour guide said that now they host poem days where they string up paper and anyone can come and share a poem for others to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLennon Wall"

During the first events, we met a great group of French who have quickly become our closest non-American friends. Artemis from Greece has also joined our close circle, and came with us to Budapest last weekend! I’ve also become friends with people from Germany, Austria, South Korea, Turkey and Brazil! Many of them live at the external dormitory, which is half an hour from campus, so it can be difficult to make plans, but it’s fun to see them at classes and ESN events. I haven’t met any Czechs yet, the ESN events aren’t geared towards Czech students and my classes are mainly international students. I have embarrassingly few group pictures with everyone, I’ll have to work on that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCzech dinner with the French!
