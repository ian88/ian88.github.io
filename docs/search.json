    "text": "This weekend I flew to Rome for a far too brief trip to visit my friends from UW who came to visit for spring break. I was only in Rome for a little bit more than a day and a half but I’d say I made the most of it. Rome has by far the most highlights of European cities I’ve been to so far. So many iconic ruins to visit. That being said, I don’t think I could ever live there, too many people and it’s not the cleanest city. \n\n\nThis was my second time at the Colosseum and it was as entrancing as the first time. It’s amazing how well it’s stood the test of time, shout out Roman concrete. It was significantly more crowded than it was last time in 2021 at the tail end of the pandemic. I wish I had been able to go inside but I ran out of time to make it happen on this trip. My friends went inside on Monday after I had left and got their photo taken by Bo Nix, the quarterback for the Denver Broncos… small flex. \n\n\n\nWe all agreed that this was the highlight of our time in Rome. I missed seeing the Pantheon last time I was in Rome and I’m super glad I got to see it this time. We were waiting in the long line to get in when we were approached by some tour guides who promised to get us in instantly and give us a private guided experience for only $10 ($15 total) more than regular admission. After some debating, we decided to go for it. Best decision! We probably avoided waiting in line for an extra hour and our tour guide was great, look up Jessica Coppola (jessicacoppola8@gmail.com) if you’re ever in Rome. It was fascinating to learn about how much effort went into building the Pantheon, from the many types of marble mined from all over the Roman Empire to the rolling of the pillars for hundreds of miles from mine to the final destination. Also shout out to Pope Boniface IV for saving the Pantheon from destruction when he restored it to use as his private place of worship. The Pantheon definitely cracks the top 3 coolest buildings I’ve seen in Europe. \n\n\n\nReally big fan of this monument, especially because it was free to go up and in. The views from the top of Rome were fantastic! Hard to imagine the amount of effort that went into lifting the 50 equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II into place on its pedestal. \n\n\n\nNot much to say about Trajan’s Forum, we found our there on the first night while wandering. Lots of cool old pillar ruins. Ancient ruins are so amazing. \n\n\n\nSant’Agnese in Agone Fountain in the center of the square was pretty but pales in comparison to the Trevi Fountain. I really liked the church next to the square, Sant’Agnese in Agone. The stone carvings inside depicting the evil doings of pagans were incredible, my favorite carvings of the trip. \n\n\n\nThe Trevi Fountain was as beautiful as the last time I saw it, although with way bigger crowds this time. It felt like we were in a club, constantly pushing our way through people. I did really like being able to go to the lower level right next to the fountain to take pictures. \n\n\n\nThe Spanish Steps were fine but overrated in my opinion, they’re just too crowded. Watching the Italian police constantly tell people not to sit down on the steps was very entertaining. I will say the view from the top of the steps was very pretty. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiber River by night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Colosseum!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boys in front of the Colosseum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pantheon is so imposing from the outside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many different types of marble inside the Patheon.

I ordered the fusilli with bacon, mushrooms, rocket, and cheese. I forgot how much I had missed fresh pasta. I definitely need to make some this summer! On Sunday we got lunch at Bona Pizza. The place was packed but counter service was quick, they had a bunch of premade slices to go. I got a delicious pepperoni slice and a weird potato and bacon slice that I ordered on accident but was still pretty good. I’m still taking the Innsbruck as the best pizza I’ve had while abroad though. Also on Sunday, we splurged for some gelato. I got vanilla and two different chocolate flavors.

The advertisement in the Wizz Air backseat magazine for becoming a pilot in two years was a bit scary to see before takeoff but both flights went off without a hitch. I really like boarding and deboarding from the front and the back of the plane, it makes everything so much more efficient. I wish more airlines in the US would do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding for Wizz Air\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 year pilot program…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding for Ryanair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItalian Police Escort\nThis was possibly the weirdest experience I’ve had abroad yet. We all had to go to the bathroom near the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II. There was a group of Italian Police standing near where we were so we went up and asked for directions to the bathroom. I’m not sure if something was lost in translation or if they were just bored but we ended up getting escorted by one of the officers to the bathroom. He stopped traffic for us and had us walk down the middle of the road, it was so surreal. I wish we had gotten a picture with the officer but we were all too focused on getting to the bathroom.\n\n\nSouvenir\nI finally got a cool souvenir! I know I should probably have been getting postcards or keychains or something in the cities I’ve visited for sentimental reasons but nothing has really called to me. Then, on the way to the Colosseum, I walked past an artist selling his drawings and they grabbed my attention. Ended up buying a three-panel piece that I loved. I’m going to try to find similar artwork during future trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFelt like a fever dream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove this simple style"

Every time I’m in the mountains I’m blown away and question why I don’t live in a mountainous place all the time. Innsbruck is the kind of city I would love to live in when I’m older. Close to the mountains, not too big, relaxed culture, great public transport, and did I mention close to the mountains? We stayed at the Meininger Hotel in a six-person hostel room. It was super nice to have a room totally to ourselves to lay out all of our stinky skiing stuff at the end of the day. The hostel was across the street from the University of Innsbruck and the Inn River. I was very jealous. Every evening at sunset, students would sit on the side of the river, drink a beer, and chat. So naturally, we did the same the nights we were there. Everyone looked so happy and carefree, exactly my type of outdoor-loving people. Downtown Innsbruck was a fifteen-minute walk from the hostel and is super cute, but we really only went there to get food. The first night we went to Stiftskeller restaurant. I ordered a delicious mac and cheese dish, which even came with a salad! Prague could never. The food came in less than five minutes, it actually might have been the fastest restaurant service I’ve ever experienced. The second night we went to a pizza place called Trattoria-Pizzeria Due Sicilie. Such a cute little Italian place with great pizza and service for a pretty reasonable price by Innsbruck standards. Might have been my favorite meal to date. On the third night, we got takeaway burritos from Machete. The burritos were pretty average, I’ve had much better in Madison, but it was fun to eat along the river.

Downtown Innsbruck was a fifteen-minute walk from the hostel and is super cute, but we really only went there to get food. The first night we went to Stiftskeller restaurant. I ordered a delicious mac and cheese dish, which even came with a salad! Prague could never. The food came in less than five minutes, it actually might have been the fastest restaurant service I’ve ever experienced. The second night we went to a pizza place called Trattoria-Pizzeria Due Sicilie. Such a cute little Italian place with great pizza and service for a pretty reasonable price by Innsbruck standards. Might have been my favorite meal to date. On the third night, we got takeaway burritos from Machete. The burritos were pretty average, I’ve had much better in Madison, but it was fun to eat along the river. I’m really hoping to be able to come back to Innsbruck in May to go hiking!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe view from our room in the hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset over the Inn River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnsbruck by night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowntown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNight beers by the river\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStiftskeller dinner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrattoria-Pizzeria Due Sicilie"

    "text": "Skiing at Schlick 2000\nI love skiing in the Alps! We chose Schlick 2000 as our ski destination since it was an easy half-hour bus ride from Innsbruck. All in we spent $180 for two days of skiing and rentals which feels like a pretty great deal considering it would be more expensive to ski on crappy Midwest hills for the same amount of time. Schlick 2000 is hidden from the road by the crest of a smaller hill. It was amazing to take the gondola up and have the mountain and trails emerge in front of me. Schlick has 15 miles of groomed trails, which were starting to get repetitive by the end, but still a lot of fun, especially considering even the easiest trails near the gondola were the same difficulty as the hardest trails at the ski places I’ve been to near Madison. The most fun I had was skiing the off-piste routes with Aubrey. Lots of steep moguls and weaving around trees, it was a blast and I felt myself get more competent every run! I felt bad for the ski rental place because I put quite a few dents and scratches on my skis. Both days we skied were absolutely gorgeous. We had highs in the 40s and perfectly clear and sunny. I was skiing in only a sweatshirt and still was sweating. The snow wasn’t great, it was a weird combination of slushy at lower elevations and icy on the steeper runs near the top of the mountain. The off-piste snow was better, although a bit thin, and even the worst spots were totally manageable. One of the workers said they hadn’t gotten any snow since December, all of the snow was created. I think we might have gotten in on the last good weekend of skiing for the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of Schlick 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe skiing group!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfi at Panorama bar at the top of the mountain.

The inside of the church is pretty incredible, there are pyramid stacks and hanging arrangements built from thousands of bones of people from the 14th and 15th centuries who died from the bubonic plague and Hussite Wars.

    "text": "This week’s blog post will be a bit different. I didn’t travel anywhere for the weekend because my friend Carson was visiting from Ireland where he studies abroad so instead I want to talk about the block course I took this past week called Workshop II. Workshop II was a one-week hands-on course run by Professor Peter Kumble for students from CZU and Charles University (another university in Prague). The course is a requirement for Landscape Planning and Nature Conservation graduate students but it was open to exchange students as well. I signed up during the first week of the semester and was starting to regret my choice later in the semester because I didn’t want to be gone from Prague during one of my last weeks but ended up being glad I went. It was interesting to do more hands-on conservation work and refreshing to not be sitting in a classroom. I met a lot of great people and learned a thing or two as well. I wish the course had taken place earlier in the semester, it was great to make new friends but now I only have one week left in Prague and likely won’t see them again. It was also refreshing to spend a week away from my American friends and interact with more Europeans than I usually do.\nFor the workshop, we spent the week in the small Czech town of Slavonice. Slavonice has around 2300 residents and is located around a mile from the Austrian border. Historically, Slavonice was located along a main trade corridor in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and at one point the town had a large defensive wall and mote. Now, the town mainly relies on tourism during the summer. We were told Slavonice gets quite busy but we were there a bit early because it was very empty for most of while we were there. The small town’s character and proximity to agricultural fields and forests made it a good fit for landscape planning and native conservation work. Professor Kumble has been taking his students to Slavonice for this workshop for many years so has a good understanding of the town and surrounding area and has built relationships with many people living in Slavonice. He also brought in other professors and grad students to help with our projects for the week.\nWe spent most of our time either in the field collecting data or at the Slavonice Center for the Future analyzing the data and creating our final PowerPoints. The Center of the Future is a renovated school building that now hosts company workshops, rock shows, movies, and anything else Slavonice needs.\nFor housing, the 30 students in the Workshop were spread around the town wherever there was room. I got placed in a brand new guest house a little bit off the main square with two students from Charles University: Felix from Germany, and Luca from Italy. Both of them were very nice and easy to get along with! Our guest house had two floors and a nearly full kitchen. I got lucky enough to be by myself on the first floor with a queen bed. Not bad for $25 a night.\nOur guest house for the week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy room in the guest house\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlavonice Center for the Future"

I’m continually amazed that even some of the smallest towns in Czechia are reachable by train. Professor Kumble set everyone up in their accommodations for the week and then gave us some time for lunch. I went with Felix and Luca to a restaurant on the main square and got some pork noodles. We reconvened with the group at 3 to go in the Slavonice underground and up the lookout tower. The underground was a very unique experience. We were given rubber boots and rain jackets to put on and headed into the very narrow underground tunnels. Our guide told us the underground was originally built in the 13th century when it was used for water drainage, groundwater collection, and protection against invading armies. Now, some of the underground has been opened up to the public for short tours. Our tour was about 30 minutes long and involved crouching our way through two 50-meter stretches with a break in the middle in a larger room in the middle to learn some of the underground’s history. Crouching my way through the tunnels was probably the most confined I’ve ever been in a cave-like area. There were points when I was fully crouching and had to turn myself sideways to fit around a tight bend. Not somewhere I would want to be for extended periods. The very sporadic lighting and half a foot of water on the ground didn’t help either. Still a very unique experience that I’m glad I did. Next, we went up the clock tower in the town square. Again, it was very cramped at the top but there were great views of all of Slavonice and the surrounding area. After the tower, Professor Kumble gave us a short tour of Slavonice, pointing out the sgraffito and old outer defense wall. Sgraffito was a technique that became very popular during the 16th century in Czechia. It involves coating a wall with multiple layers of different plaster colors and then scraping away the plaster to create intricate designs. The sgraffito buildings were gorgeous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cute little two car train that brought us to Slavonice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPork noodles for lunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSqueezing our way through the narrow underground tunnels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made it throught the Underground!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old clock tower that’s now an obervation tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlavonice main square from the oberservation tower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the sgraffito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother sgraffito example"

It’s so amazing that the border between Czechia and Austria is only marked by a change of signage indicating you’re now on the Austrian bike trail. We stopped many times along the way for the professors to point out important ecological areas or inform us of the history of the area. One of the notable features was all the bunkers on the Czech side. Apparently over 1000 bunkers were built in Czechia near the beginning of WWII for use against the Germans if they invaded through Austria. The bunkers were never used but proved too difficult to remove so they’ve just become part of the Czech landscape. We spent a few hours walking through the Austrian countryside, stopping occasionally to discuss the land around us and to put up motion-sensing wildlife cameras. When we crossed back into Czechia, Kumble pointed out what looked to be a thriving forest and said that this used to be a small Czech town until the Iron Curtain was formed. The town was too close to the border and could have provided Czechs with an easier location to try to escape to Austria. There was no visible evidence of the town from the path which was incredible. In general, it was amazing how little evidence of the Iron Curtain still exists in the area. No signs of the barbed border wall and associated border surveillance were evident except for some very straight military roads. We stopped for lunch at a delicious small restaurant seemingly in the middle of nowhere called Restaurace Maříž. After lunch, we continued back towards Slavonice. We stopped once on the way to look at the ruins of an old manor house. In total, we walked almost 15 miles.

We took water samples at the headwater spring and three of the nearby downstream fish ponds. On the bike ride back we stopped at the ruins of an ancient farming village. Back in Slavonice, we took water samples, before, inside, and after the village. We spent the rest of the day and most of Thursday analyzing the data, collecting more data when needed, and creating a PowerPoint displaying our findings and possible solutions. We discovered that the Slavonice Waste Water Treatment Plant was releasing very high concentrations of NO3 into the stream. We proposed the creation of a small constructed wetland to remove the NO3 but that would involve a fairly significant investment from the town. On Wednesday night the Institute hosted a cookout for the students on the Workshop and local people from Slavonice.

    "text": "Bratislava Friday\nWe took the Můj Vlak train to Bratislava from Prague and arrived at 2 pm. It was a nice change of pace to take a train instead of a bus. Technically, we had assigned seats, but we wanted a table to play cards together, so we would pitch up in a spot and then move when someone kicked us out. Bratislava felt like a ghost town. Maybe it was the rainy weather, but there was hardly anyone outside, which felt strange compared to the other cities we visited. We checked into our hostel for the weekend, Patio Hostel. It was nice to have private dorm rooms, but the hostel was pretty lacking; the bathrooms were still shared with the rest of the floor, and it felt like we were the only ones under the age of 40. Maybe Bratislava doesn’t get a lot of young tourists, or maybe we just messed up and picked a hostel that caters to older travelers. But it was cheap and we didn’t have to spend much time there, so I can’t complain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived in Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery cool map of old Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool water pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUFO Tower\nThe UFO Tower was our first stop in Bratislava. It was $11 to go up to the observation deck, which felt a bit overpriced, but the view was fantastic. The wind was blowing strongly, but at least it stopped raining. We had a full 360 panorama of Bratislava and the surrounding area. Bratislava looked like it had three distinct areas. An older area which looked more similar to the area around Prague Castle, the downtown with skyscrapers, and the residential area with dozens of copy-paste Soviet-style apartment buildings. It was strange to see skyscrapers after not having any in Prague or Budapest, considering how culturally similar they are. There were a lot of small river cruise ships. I think a cruise down the Danube from Vienna to Budapest, passing through Bratislava and small towns, would be interesting. I liked how much green there was on the west side of the river, and northwest of the city, there were over a hundred wind turbines. The UFO tower is apparently part of the World Federation of Great Towers, joining the Space Needle, Eiffel Tower, Burj Khalifa, Sears Tower, and many more, although it didn’t really feel as worthy of the honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinately looks like a UFO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView of Western Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView of Eastern Bratislava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCold and windy group photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBratislava Castle\nOur second stop of the day was the Bratislava Castle. On the way, we stopped at St. Martin’s Cathedral, which was very large but not as ornate as a lot of the other Cathedrals I’ve visited. It feels blasphemous to say, but I think I prefer Bratislava Castle to Prague Castle, although if I’m including the Cathedral in the center of Prague Castle, then it probably gets the edge. The Castle also had a nice view of the city. We walked around the outside a bit, but the inner courtyard was closed, so we decided to leave and come back on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBratislava Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGardens in the back of the castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner\nFor dinner, we went to the Slovak Pub, which came highly recommended online. I ordered the potato pierogi, which was fine but not exceptional. They didn’t have the 1L beers like we had been told, and the service wasn’t great, so overall we weren’t too impressed. Maybe we went on a bad night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner at the Slovak Pub"

    "text": "Vienna Saturday\nWe took the RegioJet bus to Vienna at 7:30 am this morning. We beelined for breakfast first. All of the cafes that were recommended to us had huge lines, but we ended up at a place called Stadtcafe, and I got a delicious breakfast sandwich. First stops after that were St Peter’s Cathedral and the Sisi Museum. The architecture of Vienna is amazing! Behind the Museum was a huge open area with a lot of museums. There were some people playing spikeball, so of course Peter and I asked to join for a game. They had cleats and Spikeball jerseys, and we got destroyed, but it was a blast. I love how Vienna has public water filling locations scattered around the city; more places in Europe need to do this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakfast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St. Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe St. Peter’s organ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSisi Museum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince Eugene Monument\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpikeball!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Stephen’s\nSt. Stephen’s is definitely the flagship of Vienna. I loved the Gothic architecture style, with so much intricate detail. The interior was huge with lots of amazing stone carvings. We wanted to go up into one of the towers, but the admission fee was cash only, and not everyone had enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Stephen’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelvedere\nI loved the Belevdere Palace! Really beautiful gardens to walk through and enjoy. The view across the reservoir to the Palace was amazing. Unfortunately, the museum was sold out of tickets for the day so I’ll have to come back another time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelvedere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower Belvedere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup pic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHundertwasser House\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like the Hundertwasser House. The architectural style felt a bit like a post-apocalyptic apartment complex. I’m curious if anyone actually lives in the apartments or if it’s mainly just a tourist attraction. There was a large gift shop building too, I was so tempted to get one of the matted paintings, but $50 was a bit more than I wanted to spend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Stephen’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner\nFor whatever reason, we decided to trust Tristan with finding a place for dinner. He made a reservation for Chez Bernard, which was quite a bit fancier than we were used to. The restaurant was on the 7th floor of a nice hotel. The meal was $45 a person for a main dish and a beer. The food was very good, but I was definitely not ready to be paying so much for it. The restaurant also added a $5 per person place setting charge, which apparently is common for upscale Austrian restaurants, but I had never seen that before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken and austrian gnocci\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitzcarraldo Speakeasy\nAfter dinner, we headed to a speakeasy that Tristan was obsessed with finding. To get in, we had to press a button on a vending machine, and the speakeasy was hidden behind it. The place was very small and dim, but the atmosphere was perfect. All the tables were reserved, but they had space for us to stand at the bar, which turned out to be much more fun because we could watch the bartenders make the fancy drinks. Rafe and I ordered the Elyx Gimlet, which came on top of a rock holder with a light underneath. The drink started bright purple, but then the bartender poured in something that turned the whole drink neon green. Peter and Violette ordered a drink that came with a foot-tall tower of bubbles that they had to eat before getting to the actual drink. Paying $18 after spending so much on dinner was not great, but for the experience, it was worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVending machine entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the speakeasy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy neon green drink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nSo cool to watch them make it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nPeter had fun with this one"

There was an Easter service happening, so we could only peek inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Blue Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedieval Market\nWe made it back to Bratislava Castle for the medieval market. Unfortunately, I didn’t take any pictures, but the market was great. There were like 15 stalls with people dressed in medieval attire selling handmade pottery, wooden bowls, knives, necklaces, and many other things. They also had a few food stands which I didn’t try but looks pretty good."

The markets had been up for a couple of weeks, but this was my first time going. We visited the markets in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. They sold very similar stuff, lots of kielbasa, shish kebabs, jewelry, and hot wine, but it was great to hang out on such a beautiful day. I did find a stand selling small drawings of popular Prague landmarks, I purchased one of Old Town Square that I really liked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEaster Market in Old Town Square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful tulips with St. Nicholar Church in the background\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhipping Tradition\nOne of the most unique and interesting Easter traditions in Czechia is the whipping tradition. On Easter Monday, Czech boys collect willow branches and braid them together to create a whip. They decorate the whip with ribbons and then whip girls. The whipping is supposed to bring the girls good luck and fertility. Predecorated whips were being sold at all of the Easter Markets and even on campus. From what I saw, the tradition isn’t really done anymore in Prague; the selling of whips is more just honoring the history of the tradition at this point."

    "text": "This was my third time visiting Cork, although I was too young to remember the first time, and the second time was just driving through. My main purpose for coming to Cork was to visit my grandmother, Breda! She grew up in the area and moved back full-time about a decade ago. Only staying one night was far too short of a visit with her but I was still glad to be able to visit. She lives in a cute little house near Ballincollig, about a half-hour drive from Cork city center. It was really nice to be able to sleep somewhere that wasn’t a hostel dorm room! I didn’t arrive in Cork until the late afternoon on Thursday so we didn’t really have time to sightseeing so we made the most of it on Friday. Started off on Friday with a Hop-on Hop-off bus. Normally I would never think of touring a city like this but it was actually pretty great. I got to see a lot of the Cork highlights in only an hour and a half. I think my favorite site was the Shandon Clock Tower, which the tour guide said was the largest 4-faced clock tower until Big Ben was built. When the tower was originally built the clock hands were made of wood and the locals called it the “Four-Faced Liar” because the hands would get blown in the wind and all tell a different time. After the bus tour, we walked around the University College Cork campus. Loved this campus, the original campus building was a beautiful old castle-looking building with a lot of nice green space. Next, we headed back to St. Patrick’s St, the central hub of Cork that traverses the Cork island. Breda grew up in the area and spent a lot of her life in Cork so she knew the history of almost every building and how it had changed in the last century! We spent the afternoon walking around Cork’s churches and cathedrals, including Saint Fin Barre’s Cathedral, St Peter’s, and the Irish Franciscans Church.

    "text": "Dublin\n\nGuinness Storehouse\nDespite probably being the number one tourist attraction in Dublin I loved the Guinness Storehouse. For only 30 euros to visit the whole building with a free Guinness sample and pint it seemed like a pretty decent deal too. The whole storehouse is totally over the top with large exhibits dedicated to the ingredients, brewing process, advertising, and legacy of Guinness. I learned a surprising amount about the brewing of Guinness and loved the section about the advertising schemes, there were so many random goofy posters with animals. “Lovely day for a Guinness!”. The tour ended at the top of the Storehouse with fantastic views of Dublin. I definitely gained a new appreciation for Guinness as a company and am now a certified Guinness enjoyer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrazy water display, the glasses are just made up of falling water droplets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sure how one becomes a yeast mega fan but I’m all for it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying a free Guinness at the end of the tour, once again I failed to split the G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoofy advertising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral\nCarson and I spent a solid hour and a half in St Patrick’s Cathedral, the National Cathedral of Ireland. There was a 10 euro admission fee but an audio tour of the Cathedral was included. The audio tour shared a lot of really interesting history of the Cathedral. My favorite part was all the old flags hung up to commemorate Irish soldiers and the Knights of St Patrick’s. There was also a lot of really great stained glass, I think the Irish churches have the most beautiful stained glass of anywhere I’ve been. Entertainingly the Cathedral probably wouldn’t be around today if it wasn’t for the 1860-1865 restoration funded by the Guinness family for the equivalent of 22 million euro today. Carson and I were joking that it seems like everything in Dublin is connected to Guinness somehow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Patrick’s Knights, I love these old flags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful stained glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper cool spiral staircase to the organ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI swear everything in Dublin is connected to Guinness somehow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\nAbbey Court Hostel\nIn Dublin, we stayed at the Abbey Court Hostel, definitely the strangest hostel I’ve been in yet. Every wall was covered in artwork and the place was a total maze, to get to our dorm room we had to walk through part of the women’s bathroom. It was $70 per night for a six-bed dorm room which was the cheapest we could find in Dublin, seems so crazy expensive compared to the $20-30 per night I’ve paid in other cities. The price did include free breakfast, although it was shitty, and a game room with foosball, table tennis, and pool which we had fun in.\n\n\nGardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham\nWe arrived a half hour early for our Guinness Storehouse tour so to kill some time we wandered over to a nearby park which ended up being great. The gardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham felt like something straight out of Game of Thrones with all the manicured hedges. We found a fun little bird that wanted to pose for a picture too.\n\n\nNational Gallery of Ireland\nOn Sunday morning we had an hour to kill between the hostel check-out and when I had to take the bus to the airport so we decided to check out the National Gallery. Amazingly the Gallery is free for anyone and has a lot of really amazing art. I loved all the landscape paintings. I would highly recommend spending some time there if you have some time to kill in Dublin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hostel walls were covered in artwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoosball!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDublin Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGardens at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle bird was posing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite paintings from the National Gallery"

For lunch on Sunday we got poke bowls which might actually be the healthier meals I’ve had yet, and it tasted great. For dinner on Saturday we went to White Rabbit.

The university is in Prague 6, about seven miles from the city center, which ends up being around a half hour away on public transport. The campus itself is pretty small, especially compared to the sprawling University of Wisconsin I’m used to. It’s nice to have all my classes within a quick 7-minute walk, and for the campus to be mostly car-free. There are around 20,000 students who study at CZU, but it honestly feels a fair bit smaller. My largest class only has like 15 students. The campus buildings feel new, or at least recently remodeled, with nice classrooms and layouts.

I’m used to the rigor of UW classes so it’s jarring to only meet for classes once a week for an hour and a half lecture, and then have virtually no assignments to do between classes. While at CZU I’m in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and am taking all ecology courses: Wetland Conservation and Management, Forest Ecology, Non-forest Vegetation, and Ecosystem Conservation and Management. Two of my courses have twenty-minute presentations as the only assignment besides the final, another one has some short readings. My last class doesn’t have any assignments, just a couple of half-day field trips, which hopefully are a good experience. It’s nice to have more free time than in Madison, but I am quickly realizing that I need the consistency of assignments to occupy my days and make me feel like I’m doing something productive. The lectures do teach a fair bit of information, but without assignments, I don’t think very much of it will sink in. I’m just hoping I take some knowledge away from the semester so the courses aren’t a total waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding for the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, although none of my courses are here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Powerpoints for my Wetland Conservation and Management Course leave a lot to be desired"

There are no common rooms, just a very cramped room with a ping-pong table. The dorm rooms are reasonably big but the linoleum floor collects dust like nobody’s business. We share a bathroom with two people in the room next door, which isn’t too bad, but the bathroom looks like it hasn’t been updated since the 50s and all the cabinets are rusted shut. It’s all manageable because the room costs less than $300 per month, but we know people in the same dorm who have a brand new updated bathroom despite paying the same, so we’re salty. The one good thing I can say about the bathroom is that the water pressure and heat are top notch. For cooking, the dorm room comes with a mini fridge and small hot plate, which just barely does the job. I’ve been able to make breakfast burritos, pasta, and curry, but only having one burner feels very limiting. Thankfully the grocery store is only a 10 minute bus ride away and I shop multiple times per week so the mini fridge isn’t too restrictive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKolej JIH exterior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dorm room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking all of my meals on one hotplate is not going to be enjoyable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvery subpar bathroom, if only the cabinets weren’t rusted shut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe view from my dorm room is fantatic!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven better after snow!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhot plate breakfast burrito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhot plate pesto pasta"

    "text": "Friday\nBig day of beach hopping!\n\nCaló des Moro\nUnfortunately, one of our rental cars got rear-ended on the way to the beach, but thankfully, we had paid for full insurance coverage, and only the license plate was damaged. Caló des Moro was gorgeous! The water was crystal clear, and cliffs jutted out into the ocean. Reminded me a bit of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula. There were people cliff jumping on the other side of the beach, so naturally we had to join in. The cliff was only like ten feet above the water, but it was such a blast. We only went in twice, though, because it was cold and windy when we got out. Honestly, the water felt warmer than the air. We still ended up hanging out for a long while and even ate lunch there. After we walked around one of the cliffs to another beautiful beach. The whole area was managed by a local family, which I think is great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallorca is stunning!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCliff jumping!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mallorca group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaló des Moro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Caragol\nThis beach was a bit of a nightmare to get to. Google Maps had no idea that the route it wanted us to take involved private, gated-off roads. It took us a lot of tries to figure out where to go. At one point, we found ourselves on a narrow one-lane dirt road that abruptly dead-ended. We had to do a 25-point turn to get back on track. Half an hour later, we finally made it to the beach. It was a half-mile walk along the coast to the beach from the parking lot. Cabrera Island was visible in the distance the whole time. It would be interesting to visit at some point since I think it’s all a national park. We didn’t actually make it to the beach because we found a fun rock outcropping with some old stone structures to explore. And no one was in the mood to swim with the cool weather and wind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot ourselves into a bit of a jam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabrera Island in the distance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA strange sight on the beach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEs Pontàs and Cala Santanyi\nI loved the Es Pontàs arch! Such a cool natural formation, I was surprised it wasn’t more crowded at the lookout point. Cala Sanranyi was the most touristy of the beaches we visited today. There were a lot of hotels built right next to it. Luckily, it wasn’t crowded. We lay out on towels for an hour until it got too cold. The only person swimming was a small kid who was having fun trying to jump over the waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEs Pontàs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArch pic with Peter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking\nForgot how much I missed cooking in a proper kitchen!

    "text": "Saturday\n\nBoat cruise\nMost of today was spent on a boat cruise through Magic Catamarans! It was fantastic to spend so much time on the water, but it was very cold. The weather was overcast most of the day, and there was a lot of wind on the boat. We hung out in mesh at the front of the boat the whole time. They offered snorkeling equipment, which we were stoked about before the cruise, but after getting whipped around by the cold wind, no one was excited about jumping in the water, and there wasn’t anything to see underwater either. We were served a decent lunch with a kebab, chicken breast, brat, and salad. They also gave out glasses of sangria, which helped take the chill off. Warmer weather and sun would have made it a better experience, but we still had a great time, hard to complain when you’re on the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatamaran!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone on the boat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved laying on the netting but it was chilly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoat lunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalma\nWe finished the cruise at around 3 and headed into the Palma city center. We got our souvenir shopping out of the way and visited Palma Cathedral. We weren’t able to go inside, but the architecture was stunning! Love the gothic style. We walked around the area a bit more and randomly stumbled on a rock festival, which was entertaining. From our brief visit, I really liked Palma, especially all the narrow alleys lined with shops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the trees lining this street\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalma Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove the architecture of the Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSóller\nAfter Palma, we drove for an hour to the small town of Sóller. The road there passed through the longest tunnel I’ve ever been in; it must have taken at least 5 minutes to go through. I attempted to hold my breath, but quickly realized it was futile. Sóller was a very pretty little town nestled in the mountains. We parked and walked to the main square, where there was a traditional dance happening. There were maybe 50 people of all ages dancing in unison. We watched for at least 15 minutes, it would have been fun to be able to learn how to do it; they were all very good. The town square was also home to the Parroquia de Sant Bartomeu de Sóller. The architectural style felt very similar to Palma Cathedral, very pretty! Unfortunately, the restaurant we wanted to go to for tapas was fully booked, so we ended up at a place a few minutes from the main square. I ordered the beef cheek tacos. They were good, but nothing amazing. I would have rather had our homemade tacos from last night again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParroquia de Sant Bartomeu de Sóller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional dancing in the town square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef cheek tacos"

    "text": "Friday\nWe took the overnight RegioJet bus from Prague to Kraków. After doing the same to get to Budapest, I thought we agreed to not do it again, yet here we were. The RegioJet was more comfortable than the FlixBus, but the 30-minute layover to switch buses in Brno guaranteed that I slept minimally. We arrived blurry-eyed in Krakow at 6:30. After dropping our stuff at Greg and Tom’s Beer House Hostel, we went to grab breakfast at a small cafe. I had a delicious chocolate croissant and proceeded to fall asleep almost instantly, and I wasn’t the only one. We spent the morning at Wawel Royal Castle, one of the major Kraków castles. The Castle is famous for representing almost all major European architectural styles, which was very cool to see. The metal dragon in front of the castle was also quite the sight, especially since it breathed fire every five minutes. For lunch, we found a small kimbap restaurant. I think this might have been my first time having kimbap, and I definitely enjoyed it. Next stop was the Bunny Cafe. For $5, we got half an hour to sit and hang out with bunnies in the cafe. They gave us shoe coverings and a cup of grass to feed the bunnies. Many of them were quite shy, but others happily took the food. They were also enormous! Probably the largest bunnies I’ve ever seen. Such an entertaining thing to find in the middle of Kraków. We spent the afternoon in the salt mines and then came back for dinner at Restauracja Smakotyki. I ordered the meat dumplings, but was a bit underwhelmed, finding a place with perogies on the menu would have been a better bet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking the overnight RegioJet was not ideal for sleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolate croissant for breakfast might be the best croissant I’ve had abroad yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrival selfi in Wawel Royal Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWawel Dragon, it spits real fire every 5 minutes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe many domes of Wawel Royal Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInner castle garden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKimbap lunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBunny cafe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtemis at bunny cafe, this bunny was absolutely enormous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDumpling dinner at Restauracja Smakotyki\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalt Mines\nWieliczka Salt Mine was incredible! This is a must-see if you visit Krakow, and it was an especially perfect thing to do on the very rainy day we had. They offered the Tourist Route or the Miners Route. Unfortunately, the Miners Route was sold out for the day, but the Tourist Route was still great. They paired about 30 of us with an English tour guide, and we descended over 25 flights of stairs to 64 meters below ground. At the deepest point of the tour I think we were over 120 meters below ground. The tour was a bit overcrowded, so it was hard to hear and felt a bit rushed at times, but we still learned a lot about the mining culture, the pulley system for extracting the rock salt, the immense wooden scaffolding required to keep shafts open, and how the mine evolved. One of the most interesting facts was how the miners would carry lit torches into mined corridors to burn off the methane released while mining before it got to lethal or explosive levels. There were a bunch of cool rock salt sculptures along the tour, but by far the most amazing part was the salt cathedral. The miners wanted somewhere to worship while in the mines, so they built a bunch of small chapels throughout the mines and one large cathedral in a huge open room. It was jaw-dropping. The cathedral walls were lined with murals carved by miners depicting religious scenes like the Last Supper, and the chandeliers were created from thousands of small salt pieces. The tour lasted around three hours, and it’s safe to say we were all incredibly impressed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 flights of stairs down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stairs ended 64 meters below the surface, the deepest point of the tour was 120 meters below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorses were used to pull this elaborate system to bring large cylinders of mined rock salt up one level at a time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalt Cathedral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Supper carved in rock salt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunderground salt lake, 9 meters deep in some places\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to imagine how much structural engineering work went into building this 100 meters deep"

    "text": "Saturday\nStarted today at the brutally early hour of 4 am to catch our tour group’s bus to Auschwitz. When we signed up for the tour, we were supposed to leave at 7:30 am, but the time got bumped up only a couple of days before. This was the first indication that we gotta a bad tour company. We arrived at Auschwitz at 6:30 am and were told we had to wait in line for the free first-come, first-served tickets. Our tour group declined to tell us while booking that we would be waiting in line with everyone instead of getting prebooked passes like the fancier tour groups. The line didn’t start moving until the ticket desk opened at 7:30, and we waited until 10:30 to get our tickets. Luckily, the time passed pretty quickly, playing word games and sharing riddles. Unfortunately, our 10:30 arrival at the ticket desk only guaranteed us tickets for the 4:15 pm time slot. Auschwitz is moving to a digital ticketing system on May 1st (so it should already be in place), meaning we only missed by less than a week. I know I shouldn’t be complaining so much while visiting Auschwitz, but it was frustrating to be told one thing while booking and show up to a completely different experience. After getting our tickets, we took the bus to Birenau for a few hours before coming back for our 4:15 Auschwitz time slot. We didn’t get back to the hostel until almost 9 pm. Thankfully, the hostel had free dinner from 9-10:30, and it was surprisingly good, with a large variety of dishes. Shout-out Greg and Tom! Probably the most mentally taxing day of study abroad yet, but definitely a worthwhile experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaiting in line to get tickets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly good free dinner at the hostel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirkenau\nWalking through Birkenau, one of the most notorious death camps of WWII, on one of the nicest days of the year was a very strange juxtaposition. We entered the camp through Hell’s Gate, where new arrivals to the camp were brought in by train. Most of the camp is ruins after the SS bombed it to erase evidence of their crimes at the end of WWII. We walked through rows upon rows of brick chimneys that used to be attached to wooden barracks that were burned to the ground. The two main gas chamber buildings at the end of the camp were also reduced to rubble. There was a small sign explaining the various chambers in the buildings, but in general, there was limited signage, instead, it was more about taking in the immense scale of the killing that took place. I did at times wish we were part of one of the larger tour groups to get more information at each historical stop. At the end of our circuit around Birkenau, we stepped into a few reconstructed buildings displaying the living situation of prisoners in the camp. Four or more people were crammed into each level of a bunk bed, with 400 people sharing a barracks with only small stoves to serve as heating in the cold winters. Bathroom conditions weren’t any better and Nazi guards made prisoners go to the bathroom in large groups for efficiency. I don’t want to imagine the punishment for having to go to the bathroom out of turn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entrance building through which men, women, and children were brought by train to Birkenau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Monument to the Victims of Fascism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘To the memory of the men, women, and children who fell victim to the Nazi genocide. Here lie their ashes. May their souls rest in peace.’ There were many instances of these memorial headstones throughout Birkenau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuins of one of the two major gassing chambers, both were bombed by the SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of Birkenau remains ruins after the SS bombed the death camp during the end of the war to cover up their crimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreated bunk rooms show what living situations were like in Birkenau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreated bathroom buildings show what toilets were like in Birkenau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuschwitz\nThe Auschwitz museum was designed in a way that we couldn’t see the camp from the parking lot, only after entering the museum and walking down a large corridor did we emerge in the camp. Walking through the Arbeit Macht Frei entrance gate was a very surreal experience. The first thing I noticed was how intact all of the buildings in Auschwitz were compared to Birkenau. Almost all of the buildings were dedicated to showing some aspect of the life of the men, women, and children living in the camp. The Auschwitz museum had a very different feel from many holocaust museums in the United States. There was less overall information, and the exhibits focused much more on the prisoners in Auschwitz as opposed to the Nazis and Hitler. I don’t remember seeing a single mention of Hitler in Auschwitz. I think this different style of museum worked very well for Auschwitz because, similar to Birkenau, it’s more about being in the location where so many horrors were experienced. One of the most powerful parts was the images of men and women lining the walls in many of the buildings. Under the images was listed the name, occupation, date of arrival at Auschwitz, and date of death. For almost every person, they passed away less than a year after they arrived. Because of our late arrival time, we only had two hours to experience the museum, we definitely could have spent a couple more hours because we weren’t able to go inside all of the building exhibits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ which translates to ‘work makes (one) free’ hangs above one of the main entrances to Auschwitz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Wall where numerous camp prisoners were shot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuard towers were posted frequently around the perimeter making escape nearly impossible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo walls of barbed wire surround the entirety of Auschwitz"

    "text": "Public Transport\nI think my favorite part about Prague might be the public transport. With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decent to the metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe buses to campus can be absolutely packed during the school day but thankfully they come every five minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are cables for the trams everywhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many train tracks from the central station!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the train on the way back from a hike"

It’s easy to see how Czechia has by far the highest beer consumption of any country. The get-to-know-you events (human bingo, trivia, tour of Prague) for students studying abroad put on by the European Student Network either took place at a bar or ended at one. Even the dorms on campus have bars on the ground floor, not to mention the CZU club. It’s very jarring to see the heavy drinking culture in Madison get outmatched almost instantly in Prague. That being said, there is plenty to do in Prague that doesn’t involve drinking, it’s just harder to find places to hang out that aren’t bars than I would like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESN organized beer pong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beer heads are so huge here"

Some of my favorites include Bageterie Boulevard, a Czech chain that serves delicious warm baguette sandwiches, Vietfood, which serves surprisingly good Vietnamese and other asian dishes, and any kebab shop we can find. I think kebabs make up half of the meals I’ve eaten in Prague, and that’s not even that much of an exaggeration.

During the first events, we met a great group of French who have quickly become our closest non-American friends. Artemis from Greece has also joined our close circle, and came with us to Budapest last weekend! I’ve also become friends with people from Germany, Austria, South Korea, Turkey and Brazil! Many of them live at the external dormitory, which is half an hour from campus, so it can be difficult to make plans, but it’s fun to see them at classes and ESN events. I haven’t met any Czechs yet, the ESN events aren’t geared towards Czech students and my classes are mainly international students. I have embarrassingly few group pictures with everyone, I’ll have to work on that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCzech dinner with the French!

The public transportation was fantastic, possibly even better than Prague’s, which is a high bar to pass, and the metro stations were super unique looking.

Three hours soaking in warm pools and saunas was so delightful, I need to find something similar in Prague. I can highly recommend Lukacs Baths if you’re ever in Budapest, only $10 for the whole day! We spent the rest of the day sightseeing! First on the agenda was St. Stephen’s Basilica, I didn’t have time to go inside, but the outside was very impressive. Next up was the Hungarian Parliament Building, which I would put in the running for most beautiful parliament building in the world, especially when it’s lit up at night. From there we went to the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe. Tickets to go inside were $30, unfortunately, but we walked around the outside and read up on the building’s history. Last on the landmarks list for the day was the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture, which looked like a castle, with a moat and everything. For dinner we went to a restaurant called Babka, I ordered the Jemen Goulash. It was delicious and the presentation was amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Budapest at 6am!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoved the thermal bath house\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHungarian Parliament, the largest building in Hungry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo beautiful lit up at night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Stephen’s Basilica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDohány Street Synagogue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum of Hungarian Agriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoulash dinner"

Learning about the history of the Siege of Budapest by the Soviets and Romanians at the end of World War II was sobering. I’m amazed at how well the city has recovered after having its population and buildings so decimated. We didn’t end up going into the Castle to the history museum, but the view of Budapest from the top was beautiful. We managed to be timed perfectly for the hourly changing of the guards, I like that ceremonial stuff like that still has a place. Next we visited the Church of Saint Matthias which is one of the most incredible buildings I’ve ever seen. The hexagon tiling on the roof and the golden interior was all so amazing. For sunset we went to Gellért Hill, which has beautiful bluffs that overlook the city center. We ended the night with a prosecco cruise. Unlimited prosecco and truffle pasta is a dangerous combination but we had a great time.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nThe hourly guard change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthias Church!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthias Church interior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup picture on Gellért Hill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecco Cruise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset panorama, Budapest is beautiful"

After checking into the Wombat hostel, which I can highly recommend, we headed out to see the sights. We visited Munich Cathedral, St Peter’s Cathedral, and the New Town Hall in Munich’s central square, Marienplatz. St Peter’s Cathedral was beautiful with gold statues and murals, and we were lucky enough to have a live choir performing while we were there. We also paid to climb up the south tower for fantastic views of Munich. The view of the New Town Hall from the top was incredible, such a unique-looking building. We climbed down in time to catch the last of the three daily clock shows. The buildup of bells chiming took a full 10 minutes before the show started but it was worth the wait. Life-sized figures reenact jousting and dancing scenes from Munich’s history. It knocked the Prague astronomical clock’s show out of the water. For dinner, we went to Hofbräuhaus which was the largest restaurant I have ever been in, there was easily seating for 1000 people. We enjoyed some beer steins and traditional German food, it was a good time. Day two was rainy all morning. We were cold and wet on our walk to Eisbachwelle to see the river surfers but it was well worth it. They were incredible. What a cool thing to be able to do in the middle of a big city like Munich. After watching for a while we migrated to a St Patrick’s Day festival with live music but we were all so cold that we left pretty quickly. Near the festival, we stopped at Theatine Church and St. Michael München. Theatine Church had incredible stone carvings throughout the church, I can’t imagine the amount of work that went into it. Overall I enjoyed Munich, it was nice to walk from our hostel to all of the famous buildings in under half an hour. The food was good but expensive compared to Prague. I wish we had gotten better weather but we got so spoiled in Innsbruck that we were due for a not-as-good weather weekend, and it really only rained for a few hours the whole time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrived in Munich!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarienplatz Square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New Town Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of St. Peter’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic View of Munich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying some steins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWet morning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe surfers were so cool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Theatine Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside St Michael’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo close to a perfect split the G, happy St Patrick’s Day weekend!"

I created Land on Fire to share what I have learned while following this story.\nThe severity of wildfires has been well-documented in the media, particularly over the past decade. However, many of these stories only discuss the extent, severity, and firefighting techniques used in association with the fire. I wanted to ensure that I was telling a more comprehensive story to help contextualize the root causes of California’s increasing wildfires. \nArcGIS StoryMaps was chosen as the medium for my project to make it more interactive and to provide more information than I could convey through an infographic. The graphs in my project were created using Python, with coding help from ChatGPT. All maps were made in ArcGIS Pro, with design enhancements made with Adobe Illustrator. \nI hope this story can provide a visually compelling and informative look at the causes and effects of California wildfires.\n\n\nView Land on Fire in a new tab"

The project provided me with a valuable introduction to processing eBird data and using it to make spatial correlations.\nArcGIS StoryMaps was chosen as the medium for my project to make it more interactive and to provide more information than I could convey through an infographic. The processing of eBird data was done in QGIS and R, with coding help from ChatGPT. All maps were made in QGIS, with design enhancements made with Adobe Illustrator. \nI hope this story can provide a visually compelling and informative look at Sandhill Crane wintering patterns in California.\n\n\nView The Long Winter in a new tab"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This semester-long collaborative project with Will McAllister for Geography 578: Applications of GIS provides an introductory analysis of the equity of public transit access to hiking trails in San Francisco, CA. Through our analysis, we evaluated the following research statement:\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is known for its hiking trails, but public transportation inequities are a potential barrier for many communities to access them. We seek to evaluate access to unpaved hiking trails in the San Francisco Bay Area by creating a distance matrix of the duration of travel by public transportation from census block group centroids in the City of San Francisco to trailheads. We will then overlay demographic data to understand how public transit access to trails varies across different socioeconomic and racial groups.\nUsing San Francisco and the Bay Area as our study area, we evaluated trail systems in the area and removed any that failed to meet our 5+ mile length and unpaved criteria. Next, we created trailheads by snapping trails to Open Street Network roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study area for our analysis, with San Francisco highlighted in purple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrails that met our 5+ mile unpaved criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailheads that are accessible within a 2.5-hour transit journey\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the R5 routing engine within the r5r R package, we calculated the total travel time and number of transit legs to reach each trailhead from each San Francisco block group centroid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of trails that are accessible by public transport in under a 2.5-hour journey from each block group centroid. San Francisco public transportation routes are overlaid to make trends more visible\n\n\n\n\nWe assigned a Trail Accessibility Score for each transit journey by summing the Duration Score and Rides Score, using the following scoring:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average Trail Accessibility Score for each block group. San Francisco public transportation routes are overlaid to make trends more visible\n\n\n\n\nFor each 2020 Census San Francisco block group, we evaluated vulnerability based on three demographic variables: income, race, and vehicle access. We then overlaid the average Trail Accessibility Scores to draw conclusions about the equity of trail accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrail accessibility by income vulnerability. San Francisco public transportation routes are overlaid to make trends more visible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrail accessibility by race vulnerability. San Francisco public transportation routes are overlaid to make trends more visible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrail accessibility by vehicle vulnerability. San Francisco public transportation routes are overlaid to make trends more visible\n\n\n\n\nFrom our analysis we found that income or race vulnerability does not significantly affect the ease of accessing hiking trails. This is likely because San Francisco has a robust public transit network, providing all communities with accessible transit. However, we found that vehicle vulnerability has some correlation with better trail accessibility. This makes some intuitive sense because the majority of the block groups with high vehicle vulnerability are located near the BART line. For people living in these block groups, a car may not be as necessary because there is a good public transportation system. However, further research is needed before more concrete conclusions can be drawn.\nLearn more about the background, detailed methodology, and expanded discussion of our project by clicking to read the full project report"
