With the student pass, I pay five dollars a month for unlimited access to the metro, buses, and trams to get anywhere in the city. The longest I’ve ever had to wait for transit is about ten minutes, and it’s always easy to grab a bus into the city from Campus. All of the metros and metro stations are very clean and I’ve never been worried about my safety or the safety of my belongings even when I’ve been riding solo. The metros cover the city really well. Most places I’ve been are less than a 10 minutes walk from the a metro station. It’s going to be difficult to go back to Madison Transit after getting spoiled here. The ticketing system here is fascinating to me. It’s basically an honor system. You buy a pass for a certain amount of time on the PID app but you never have to scan it to get on the transit. On occasion, transit police will come around and ask to see your ticket, but I’ve only been asked once a week at most. The fine if you don’t have a ticket is significant at $40, so buying a ticket is always worth it, but I can’t help but think about how much an honor system like this would get exploited in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decent to the metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe buses to campus can be absolutely packed during the school day but thankfully they come every five minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are cables for the trams everywhere!\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I’ve only used the train system twice to other parts of Czechia, more on that in a future post. I’m amazed by the ability to go to almost any small town in Czechia just by train. It is for sure less efficient than driving, but trains run once an hour, sometimes more frequently, so commuting to Prague for work or taking day trips around Czechia only by train is totally feasible. I can’t see the US ever implementing something like this but I love it so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo many train tracks from the central station!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the train on the way back from a hike"
